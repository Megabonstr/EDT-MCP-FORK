e2e tests for get_comparison_node (kind: read).

WHAT THE TOOL DOES
------------------
Expands ONE node of a comparison started by compare_configurations: a three-way
(main / other / ancestor) property table, the per-side form structure, the module
section list, the vendor-support state, the child outline and the POTENTIAL problems
the engine recorded. It reads; it never merges and never writes the project.

RESPONSE SHAPE
--------------
MARKDOWN tool: the payload lands in r.text.
  success: "# Comparison node: `<address>`" + a "| Field | Value |" summary
           (the address rides in a code span, so an address carrying a line break
           cannot end the heading and start blocks of its own)
           + "## Properties" + "## Children" + "## Potential problems"
  error:   {"success": false, "error": "..."} delivered as isError

THE ONE INVARIANT THESE TESTS EXIST FOR
---------------------------------------
The comparison tree is built LAZILY. A node the engine has not reached reads back
with no children, and a tool that rendered that state would report "no differences"
for a subtree nobody compared. So whenever the answer carries the not-finished
notice, it must NOT anywhere carry the words "no differences" - asserted on every
successful expansion below, whichever branch the timing happened to take.

CI STRATEGY
-----------
`.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml` checks out with the default `fetch-depth: 1`, so
`HEAD~1` DOES NOT EXIST on CI. Like test_compare_configurations.py, the integration
test here uses HEAD for both revisions: it resolves on any clone, needs no commit and
no branch switch, and still produces a real comparison tree to expand. WHAT a tree
containing differences renders is proved by the unit tests over stub node graphs.

ONE COMPARISON PER EDT
----------------------
The workbench runs exactly ONE comparison at a time, so the integration test starts
one, uses it, and RELEASES it before returning - a comparison left alive would make
every later test (and every later run) fail with "already running". The error-path
tests below deliberately need no comparison at all, so they cost nothing and run
even when the slot is busy.

Releasing takes both calls. This test waits for the comparison to FINISH, and a
finished comparison's job is terminal - `cancel_job` answers `alreadyTerminal` without
the owning tool's cancellation handler running, so it frees nothing. The session is
given back with `compare_configurations(releaseComparisonId=...)`. `cancel_job` still
runs first, for the paths that skip out while the comparison is still RUNNING.

    hit the platform's one-at-a-time assertion. This test shares a workbench with the
    compare_configurations tests that cancel comparisons, so it can land inside that
    window - it did on CI, and read a correct refusal as a broken expansion.

    A refusal that NEVER clears is returned as itself, and the caller decides what it
    means - see the integration test, which SKIPS on it rather than failing. The slot can
    be stuck for the rest of the workbench's life through no fault of this tool: EDT
    clears its "a comparison is active" flag only from the background job that runs the
    comparison, so a comparison cancelled before that job started leaves the flag set with
    no session behind it and no public way to withdraw it. Reporting that as a broken node
    expansion is how one workbench-wide platform state got recorded as a defect in the one
