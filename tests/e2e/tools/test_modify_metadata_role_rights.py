"""
e2e tests for modify_metadata WRITING a role's access rights - the `rights` / `roleProperties`
payload on a `Role.<Name>` FQN (#454), and the regression proof for #452.

#452: a role created through create_metadata carries NO editable rights model. The writer
materialised a RoleDescription with RightsFactory and set it on the role, but never registered that
description as a BM top object, so the transaction could not build a persistable reference to it and
the commit died with `Failed to persist reference value ...RoleDescriptionImpl@<hash>` - every FIRST
rights write on a freshly created role failed, and the failure text leaked the EMF implementation's
identity to the caller. These tests drive that exact path over the wire: seed a role, write one
right, and require the cell to land in the role's own `Rights.rights` resource on disk AND to read
back through get_metadata_details. On the pre-fix build the write returns isError and
`Rights.rights` is never created, so no assertion here can be satisfied by substring accident.

WHAT THE PLATFORM DOES WITH A RIGHT VALUE (measured in RightsModelUtil, EDT 2026.2 - not assumed).
AddRightValuesTask calls `changeObjectRight(newValue, defaultValue, ...)`, and
`getDefaultRightValue` derives that default from the ROLE's own flags: `setForNewObjects` for a
top object, `setForAttributesByDefault` for an attribute / tabular section / dimension /
resource. A value EQUAL to the default is not authored at all - an existing cell is DELETED and
an emptied object node removed. A freshly created role has both flags false (a deliberate
choice: seeding them true would turn a caller's `value:"set"` on a top object into a pruned
no-op reported as success), so `set` is authored while `unset` IS the default and prunes. That
is why the round-trip test flips `setForNewObjects` to true before it denies the right: without
the flip the second write would erase the cell and "denied" could never appear, on any build.

reset: kind="write-metadata" -> reset_fixture()+reset_model() after each test.

FIXTURE TRUTH (TestConfiguration, English Names)
  - TestConfiguration ships NO `src/Roles/` folder at all. There is no role to reuse and no rights
    matrix to read, so every test here SEEDS ITS OWN role with create_metadata - which is also
    exactly the #452 path. The seeded role is reverted by the write-metadata reset.
  - The only role that exists anywhere in the fixtures (`tests_DefaultRole`) lives in the `tests`
    EXTENSION project, which the per-test reset_fixture does NOT cover and which the PROJECT_DIR-
    scoped disk helpers cannot address. Nothing here may write into it.
  - Catalog.Catalog is the guarded object: the fixture's only catalog, and a TOP object, so its
    default right value comes from `setForNewObjects` (see above), not from
    `setForAttributesByDefault`.
  - A role's rights live in their OWN resource beside the role's .mdo, at
    `src/Roles/<Name>/Rights.rights` - not inside `<Name>.mdo`. Every disk assertion names that one
    file and goes through poll_disk_contains; poll_diff_contains is never used here, because it is
    satisfied by the substring appearing in ANY changed file and a role write touches two.
  - The on-disk shape is the v8 roles XML (`http://v8.1c.ru/8.2/roles`), where the object node is
    `<object><name>FQN</name><right><name>Read</name><value>true</value></right></object>` and the
    RightValue enum literals serialize as `true` (Set) / `false` (Unset) / `provided` (Provided).
    The right's name is stored in its invariant ENGLISH form whatever language the caller used.
