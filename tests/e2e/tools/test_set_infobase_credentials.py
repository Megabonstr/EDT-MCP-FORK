e2e tests for set_infobase_credentials (kind: action).

WHAT THE TOOL DOES
------------------
set_infobase_credentials PERSISTS the infobase connection credentials
(user/password) into EDT's per-infobase access settings — and, when the target is a
launch configuration, into that configuration's own client-user attributes as well
(see TWO CONSUMERS below). The store path is
DESIGNER-FREE: it commits via IInfobaseAccessManager.updateSettings and never opens,
connects to, or validates a designer session. Those stored credentials are later read
by EDT when update_database / launch authenticate the designer agent against an
infobase that has a user list (issue #194) — but that authentication happens in those
other tools, not here. The tool selects an EXISTING infobase user (does not create
users); an empty password is valid (demo bases). Target by launchConfigurationName
(preferred) or projectName + applicationId.

TWO CONSUMERS (#359)
--------------------
A launch has two processes that authenticate, and they read the user from different
places: the designer AGENT from EDT's per-infobase access settings (written by every
call), and the launched 1C CLIENT from the launch configuration's own attributes
(written ONLY when the target was given as launchConfigurationName). A projectName +
applicationId call therefore returns success:true with clientConfigured:false, and the
launched client keeps popping the platform's login dialog — which is exactly how #359
was reported: the call said success, run_yaxunit_tests then blocked on a password.

The client half is written into the launch configuration's own file, so it is refused
for a SHARED configuration when a non-empty password is involved: a shared .launch file
lives inside the project and is normally committed to version control. That path needs a
shared configuration to exist, which no MCP tool can create (there is no setContainer on
the wire), so it is covered by the unit tests rather than here.

RESPONSE SHAPE
--------------
JSON tool (getResponseType() == JSON); payload in r.structured:
  stored: {"success": true, "clientConfigured", "project", "applicationId",
           "applicationName", "user", "access", "passwordSet", "message"}
  error:  {"success": false, "error": "..."}

CI STRATEGY
-----------
The negative/contract matrix is CI-safe (no platform, no infobase needed): it exercises
the argument guards and the project/application resolution chain. The live happy path
(persist credentials) needs a registered infobase with a user list and is verified on
the EDT stand, not in CI.

HANG FIX (#194 follow-up)
-------------------------
The previously-reported hang was NOT in the credential store itself (updateSettings is
designer-free). It was an EDT BACKGROUND application-update-state recompute provoked by
running the model reads synchronously on the unbounded MCP worker thread, which could
loop forever waiting on a designer connection. The store is now wrapped in a bounded
background Eclipse Job joined with a short timeout: credentials are persisted FIRST, and
on timeout the recorded success is returned (else a graceful error). This is a server-side
concern only — the wire surface (params / output fields) is unchanged, so this matrix and
its assert_no_diff() stay exactly as-is.

NOTE: the tool writes EDT's per-infobase access settings (secure storage) and, for a
launchConfigurationName target, that launch configuration — never TestConfiguration
source files. A LOCAL launch configuration lives in the workspace metadata, and a shared
one would be a project file, which is exactly why the password write into a shared
configuration is refused. Every call therefore leaves the project tree clean:
assert_no_diff().
