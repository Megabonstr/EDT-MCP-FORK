"""
e2e tests for launch (kind: read).

What the tool does
------------------
launch starts an EDT session in debug mode (default) or regular run mode. It has
TWO target-selection forms, selected by which params are present (see LaunchTool.execute):

  Mode 1 — launchConfigurationName: start any existing EDT debug launch
           configuration by its EXACT name (runtime client OR an
           "Attach to 1C:Enterprise Debug Server" config). projectName /
           applicationId are NOT required in this mode.
  Mode 2 — projectName + applicationId: legacy path that finds the matching
           runtime-client launch config for that project+application and starts it.

ENVIRONMENT (why these are sentinel/negative tests, not a real launch)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a RUNTIME tool. In THIS EDT there is NO running infobase for
TestConfiguration, NO registered application, and NO pre-created EDT launch
configuration. Actually starting a session is heavy, spawns a 1C client,
and is not configured here — so we deliberately do NOT drive a real launch.

The realistic, CORRECT contract in this environment is that EVERY reachable call
fails FAST with a CLEAR, ACTIONABLE sentinel that names the missing precondition
and the next step (which sibling tool to call / what to create in EDT). That is
exactly what these tests assert — and each assertion is mutation-sensitive: a tool
that no-oped, returned a bogus success, or emitted a vague/blank error would fail.

Response shape (IMPORTANT)
--------------------------
LaunchTool.getResponseType() == JSON, so the payload is a JSON envelope. On
error the envelope is {"success": false, "error": "<message>"} and the protocol
layer flags the Result isError; assert_error returns that error string (the harness
reads structuredContent.error first). For a JSON tool r.text is only a placeholder.

Gson note: ToolResult.toJson() HTML-/quote-escapes some chars, and several of these
messages embed a single-quoted value ('NoSuchConfig'). So every error-quality
assertion below matches DELIMITER-FREE substrings (the bad bareword, "not found",
"is required", "Use get_applications", "Create it in EDT") — never a raw "'...'"
or a ">=" that Gson would have rewritten to \\uXXXX.

DIFF: launch operates on the EDT launch manager / a (would-be) running
infobase — NOT the git-tracked TestConfiguration/ source tree. So a non-destructive
guardrail applies to EVERY test: assert_no_diff() (the project source must never
change as a side effect of trying to launch a debugger).

Negative matrix coverage (all reachable branches in execute())
---------------------------------------------------------------
  - missing required params (no launchConfigurationName, no projectName)
        -> "projectName is required (or pass launchConfigurationName)"
  - Mode 2 partial: projectName present but applicationId missing
        -> "applicationId is required. Use get_applications ... or pass
            launchConfigurationName ..."
  - Mode 1: non-existent launchConfigurationName
        -> "Launch configuration not found: '<name>'. Create it in EDT first."
           (+ an availableConfigurations diagnostic list)
  - Mode 2: valid (ready) project but a non-existent applicationId
        -> "Application not found: <id>. Use get_applications to get valid
            application IDs."
  - Mode 2: non-existent projectName (+ some applicationId)
        -> readiness pre-check now refuses only the transient BUILDING state, so a
            missing project falls through to LaunchTool.launch's value-naming branch (the
            shared ProjectContext.notFoundMessage):
            "Project not found: <name>. Use list_projects to see available projects."
  - empty-string projectName behaves like missing (execute() checks isEmpty()).

Fixture inventory used (TestConfiguration, English Names): the project itself
("TestConfiguration"). It has NO registered application and NO launch config.

# There is no precondition-free success path for launch in this environment

# common real call (Mode 1 by config name) names the missing config + tells you to

# assert that actionable shape; a broken tool that silently "succeeded" (claimed a

    Skipped unless EDT_MCP_LIVE_INFOBASE=1, because it spawns a 1C client against a live
    infobase.

    WHAT THIS PROVES: the arguments survive the whole path - a stamped working copy is accepted
    by EDT's launch delegate and a debug session really comes up. Waiting for debug_status to
    report the session is the load-bearing part; without it the test would also pass on a launch
    that never started.

    WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE, deliberately and worth knowing before trusting it: that the 1C client
    actually RAN the processor. If the stamped name/type pair did not match what EDT resolves,
    the delegate logs and starts the client WITHOUT /Execute - and this test would still pass,
    because the echoed fields are built locally by the tool before the delegate runs, and
    debug_status only shows that some session exists. Closing that gap needs the fixture
    processor to leave an observable trace (write a marker file whose path arrives through the
    /C startup option, then poll for the file), which is fixture work that cannot be authored
    blind - it has to be written and RUN against a live infobase. Until then the name/type
    stamping is pinned by LaunchOverridesTest instead.

    Cleans up after itself - the spawned session is terminated and the throwaway launch
    configuration removed - so an attended run leaves the workspace as it found it.
