"""
Ratchet: this run must not add NEW error-severity entries of OUR OWN to the EDT log
(kind: read, pseudo-tool: not an MCP tool, like _mutation_set_ratchet).

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
A green suite is not the same as a healthy server. Every assertion here checks what a tool
RETURNED; nothing checks what it logged on the way. So a whole class of failure is invisible:
the tool answers correctly while an exception is swallowed behind it.

That is not hypothetical. `MetadataRenameService` built EDT's `TextSearcher` reflectively
against a pinned constructor. The platform's signature no longer matched it - and had not
matched for at least two releases - so every construction threw NoSuchMethodException, the
`catch (Exception)` logged it and returned an empty match map, and rename kept "working" on
its fallback path. 32 stack traces per run, every rename test green, nobody the wiser. The
only place that failure was visible was the EDT log.

WHAT IT CHECKS
--------------
The ratchet first makes the server write a run-unique line of its own and refuses to certify
anything unless it finds that line back. Locating a workspace does not establish that its logs
are the ones this server writes; a live workspace can belong to a different EDT instance.

Only entries whose plugin is `com.ditrix.edt.mcp.server` at severity 4 (ERROR), and only
those stamped at or after this run started. Platform noise is deliberately out of scope: EDT
logs plenty of its own errors (its Moxel editor touching a stopped namespace, its Xtext
builder opening a nested transaction, legacy BSL checks throwing) and we neither cause nor
can fix those. Ours are the ones we own.

Known, accepted messages live in `edt_log_baseline.txt`, one normalized message per line.
Most of what is in there is a VALIDATION REFUSAL logged at ERROR - a tool correctly rejecting
a bad request on a negative test, but shouting about it in the log. Those entries are
technically noise we should demote to warnings; they are baselined rather than ignored so the
list stays visible and shrinkable, and so a genuinely new error cannot hide among them.

Adding a line to the baseline is a deliberate act. Prefer fixing the log call.

    Locating a workspace does not establish whose logs are in it, and nothing on the filesystem
    can: a live .metadata belongs to whichever EDT is running, which need not be the one serving
    this suite. Only the server can answer that, so it is asked. Every tools/call that ends in an
    error outcome is logged once, at WARNING, by our own plugin, with the tool's error message
    attached (McpProtocolHandler.formatErrorLogLine), and get_project_errors names the project it
    could not find - so a project name nothing else could produce comes straight back out in the
    log. Finding it proves these files are the ones this server writes.

    That refusal is logged at WARNING and never at severity 4, so the probe cannot appear among
    the ERROR entries this ratchet reports. And the log call happens before the response is
    written, with Equinox flushing each entry as it writes it, so the line is already on disk by
    the time this returns - there is nothing to wait for.
