e2e tests for set_variable (kind: read).

Registered kind="read" — the debug-tool convention in this suite (every debug tool,
INCLUDING the mutating ones resume / step / set_breakpoint, uses kind="read"): it
mutates the LIVE debug model, never the git-tracked project, so the isolation idiom is
the read guardrail assert_no_diff(), not a file-write diff. The tool is nonetheless a
WRITE semantically — it sets a variable's value.

set_variable WRITES a BSL variable's value into a stack frame of a SUSPENDED debug
thread and returns the variable after the write. It is a pure DEBUG/RUNTIME tool: it
never touches the project source — it resolves the frame through the SAME shared
frame resolver get_variables uses (utils/DebugFrameResolver over the live Eclipse
debug model / DebugSessionRegistry), then sets the value via the plain Eclipse
IValueModification API. getResponseType() == JSON, so on the wire the payload is
structuredContent and a ToolResult.error (success:false / error field) is flagged
isError:true; the harness surfaces that error string via r.error_text()
(structured["error"]). See SetVariableTool.java + DebugFrameResolver.java.

ENVIRONMENT (the realistic happy contract here):
  In THIS EDT there is NO active debug session and TestConfiguration has NO running
  infobase / launched application, so DebugSessionRegistry holds no snapshots /
  threads / frames. set_variable therefore CANNOT reach a real variable to write; the
  REAL, CORRECT contract for every frame reference we can supply is a CLEAR,
  ACTIONABLE SENTINEL naming the missing precondition + the next step
  (wait_for_break). That sentinel IS the coverage — we deliberately do NOT start an
  infobase / launch (heavy, not configured for this fixture), so the
  happy/resume path (set a var -> get_variables re-read shows it -> resume -> new
  value in effect) is exercised MANUALLY on a live suspended session, not here.

  set_variable resolves the frame FIRST (through DebugFrameResolver, the exact triplet
  get_variables uses), so with no live session every call short-circuits on the SAME
  frame-resolution sentinels — the strings are shared with get_variables verbatim:
    - no frameRef AND no threadId, and no lone suspended debug launch
        -> "Provide frameRef or threadId — no single suspended debug session
            available for auto-resolution. Call wait_for_break first."
    - frameRef > 0 but not in the registry (stale / never issued)
        -> "stale frameRef — call wait_for_break again"
    - threadId > 0 but not in the registry (stale / never issued)
        -> "stale threadId — call wait_for_break again"

  # AUDIT: the set_variable-SPECIFIC error branches — a resolved frame whose
  # `variableName` is not found ("variable not found"), a variable that is read-only
  # / does not support modification, and an "invalid value" rejected by verifyValue —
  # are all UNREACHABLE without a live suspended frame, so they are not exercised
  # here. Reaching them needs a real launch + a breakpoint hit (e.g. inside
  # CommonModule.Calc) with a live frame whose variables can be addressed. Deferred to
  # a live-session run; flagged here so the gap is explicit rather than silently
  # skipped.

PARAMETERS:
  variableName:str (required), value:str (required); frame addressing is OPTIONAL and
  identical to get_variables — frameRef:int, threadId:int, frameIndex:int(default 0).
  Resolution order in the shared resolver: frameRef > 0 -> threadId > 0 -> lone-
  suspended fallback. Every call below supplies variableName + value so it is the
  FRAME-RESOLUTION branch (shared with get_variables) that is under test, not a
  missing-argument path. That ordering is itself a behavior under test (a stale
  threadId must surface the threadId sentinel, NOT the no-arg fallback sentinel).

DIFF: a debug-write tool mutates the running infobase / EDT debug model, never the
git-tracked project, so EVERY test asserts assert_no_diff() — a debug tool that
changed TestConfiguration source on disk would be a bug, and this catches it.
