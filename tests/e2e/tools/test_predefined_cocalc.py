e2e tests for ChartOfCalculationTypes (ПланВидовРасчета) PREDEFINED-item authoring
(#293 / PR #296, Phase 2): create_metadata / modify_metadata / get_metadata_details /
delete_metadata on the shared predefined FQN grammar

    ChartOfCalculationTypes.<OwnerName>.Predefined.<ItemName>

This is a deliberately CROSS-TOOL depth file (the documented one-file-per-tool exception,
like test_predefined_items.py / test_dcs.py): the feature spans four
existing tools, each already covered by its own primary per-tool file, so this file's
tool= tags reuse those already-covered names and add DEPTH for THIS owner kind rather than
duplicating each tool's general contract - the e2e coverage ratchet counts by tool NAME,
so reusing existing names keeps it green.

WHAT THIS SLICE GATES (the sole mechanical gate on the genuinely new mechanic): a
ChartOfCalculationTypes predefined item is FLAT (no folders / no parent nesting) and its
base / displaced / leading properties are NON-containment REFERENCES to OTHER predefined
calc-type items in the SAME chart, resolved by NAME to a live in-resource EObject inside
the write transaction. These tests prove:
  - the three reference arrays each resolve every named entry to a SIBLING item and RENDER
    the resolved target names back through get_metadata_details (reference detection +
    rendering), and full-replace on modify;
  - a non-existent sibling name is an actionable, non-mutating error;
  - the FLAT model rejects isFolder and parent with an actionable owner-scoped error, and
    the CoCalcT-only properties are rejected for any other owner (the owner-gate, mirroring
    Phase 1's applyValueType gate);
  - the delete incoming-reference check surfaces a base/displaced/leading cross-item
    reference: deleting a calc type that a sibling still cites is BLOCKED unless force=true
    (verified live per the delete_metadata guide, which names base/displaced/leading as a
    metadata cross-reference the check must catch). A timeout on that check is a real
    regression in the reference scan, so it FAILS (not skips).

SCOPE NOTE - the numeric code Value path (getCodeType()==Number → precision/scale/
non-negative validation, reusing the Catalog BigDecimal-hardened path) is exercised HERE
only positively with a code valid under either code type; its rejection edges (over-length /
fractional / negative) depend on the chart's codeType, which the top-level create wizard
fixes, so those edges are owned by the writer's UNIT tests (PredefinedWriter reuses the
already-unit-tested Catalog code path verbatim). This e2e file's gate is the reference
mechanic + rendering, not numeric-code arithmetic.

reset: kind="write-metadata" -> the orchestrator runs reset_fixture()+reset_model() after
each test, so every test SEEDS its own fresh ChartOfCalculationTypes top object first.
