"""
e2e tests for rename_metadata_object (kind: write-metadata).

The tool renames a metadata object (or a nested attribute) with full refactoring:
it updates references in BSL code, forms and other metadata. ResponseType is
MARKDOWN, so the tool body is in r.text (NOT r.structured).

TWO-PHASE CONTRACT (RenameMetadataObjectTool + MetadataRenameService):
  * confirm absent/false  -> PREVIEW only. Emits YAML "action: preview", a contentHash, a
    "## Change Points" table and "> To execute, call with `confirm=true`."
    The model is NOT mutated.
  * confirm=true          -> EXECUTE. Performs every enabled change point. Emits
    YAML "action: executed" and "# Rename Completed".

HOW THE EFFECT IS VERIFIED (two ways — the model AND the disk):
  PRIMARY: MODEL READ-BACK over the wire —
    - object rename  -> get_metadata_objects: NEW name present, OLD name absent.
    - attribute rename -> get_metadata_details(full=true): the renamed attribute
      row appears in the Attributes table, the old one is gone.
  ON DISK: a rename persists richly (the folder/.mdo are renamed Calc/ -> Compute/,
  the old .mdo deleted, Configuration.mdo's collection reference updated). The
  object-rename happy test additionally asserts WHAT changed on disk via
  poll_diff_contains — the Configuration collection element gains the new FQN AND the
  renamed object's own .mdo carries <name>Compute</name> (the export lags ~1-2s, hence
  poll). assert_no_diff() is NOT the happy-path guardrail (a rename legitimately
  changes the tree); it IS used on PREVIEW / REJECTED / NEGATIVE calls — a call that
  must not mutate must leave the working tree clean.

  The orchestrator runs reset_model() (clean_project, which refreshes the model
  from disk and discards the unsaved rename) AFTER each write-metadata test, so
  every test starts from the committed baseline. This test does NOT manage reset.

BOUNDED WAIT (issue #365): the cascade runs on EDT's UI thread and the call waits for
it with a deadline, exposed as `timeout` (seconds, default 420, clamped 60..3600). On
expiry the call returns an error naming the stage the rename reached instead of hanging
the wire. Only the wire contract is testable here — see the section near the bottom.

Whole-call error matrix (server sets isError via ToolResult.error):
  - missing projectName / objectFqn / newName -> "<name> is required" (+ usage)
  - non-existent project                      -> "Project not found: <name>"
  - non-existent / malformed object FQN       -> "Object not found: <fqn>. ..."

NOTE on substring matching: ToolResult.toJson() HTML-escapes the apostrophe and
'>' in the JSON error channel, so negative assertions only match delimiter-free
substrings (e.g. "is required", "not found", "Attribute"), never raw quoted
fragments such as 'Catalog.Products'.

Fixture (TestConfiguration, English Names): Catalog.Catalog (attribute "Attribute"),
CommonModule.Error / OK / Calc. Cascade-only modules (dedicated, do not perturb the
count-asserted objects): CommonModule.CascadeEn (English Name) and CommonModule.Вычисление
(Russian Name), both called from CommonModule.CascadeUser — see the cascade section.

    """Drain EDT's derived-data queue BEFORE a test starts a real rename.

    This test file is the single biggest source of red e2e runs: the common-module rename failed
    in 4 of the last 12 master runs, always the same way ("Renaming ... did not finish within 420
    seconds"), while passing in ~6s on the runs in between. That bimodality is the whole diagnosis
    - it is not the rename that is slow, it is the DERIVED-DATA PIPELINE it has to drain first.
    The orchestrator git-reverts the fixture before every test, EDT notices those files and starts
    recomputing, and a rename fired into that recompute ends up waiting for it from inside its own
    budget. So the deeper the PRECEDING test's diff, the likelier THIS one times out - on a cold
    shared runner most of all.

    Draining the queue before starting the clock costs seconds when there is nothing to drain and
    removes the coin flip when there is. It is NOT a timeout bump: 420s is the tool's own budget
    for a rename, and these failures are not renames that needed longer, they are renames that
    started too early. (resync_to_disk's happy path had the same flake and stopped failing once it
    got the same precondition.)

    Only for tests that actually EXECUTE a rename. A refused one - a bad FQN, a missing argument,
    a designer-owned child - never reaches the engine, so it has no pipeline to wait for and
    settling first would just spend time to prove nothing.

    Goes through settle_or_fail, which honours the wait's VERDICT. Calling the bare
    wait_for_project_ready and dropping its answer would start the rename into the very state this
    precondition exists to avoid - looking fixed while behaving exactly as before.

# call returns), and the server is single-threaded, so the very next search/read sees
# the rewrite without a poll. If a future EDT made that flush async and this flakes,

# The two-phase INDEX HANDLE (disableIndices) — issue #388
#
# A preview "#N" is a CROSS-CALL HANDLE: preview numbers the change points in one
# walk, and the confirm call re-derives the numbering in a SECOND, independent walk
# to resolve disableIndices. If the two walks disagree, "skip #N" silently skips a
# DIFFERENT change point than the caller was shown — a cascade over the whole
# configuration, applied to the wrong place.
#
# The pair below is what makes that testable over the wire: the SAME call shape with
# a DIFFERENT index must produce the OPPOSITE outcome. The reference is skipped when
# its own previewed index is passed, and rewritten when the object-rename index is
# passed instead. Neither can pass for the wrong reason — a server that ignored
# disableIndices, applied it to everything, or shifted the numbering by one fails one
# half of the pair.

# back: one that matched nothing under `unknownIndices`, one naming a point the refactoring
# requires under `notSkippableIndices`, or one this tool cannot switch off under
# `unsupportedIndices`. Entries that can never be indices are refused before execution.
#
# CommonModule.CascadeEn is the target because its change set is tiny and fully known:
# exactly two points, `#0` the bslRef in CascadeUser (Skippable: yes) and `#1` the
