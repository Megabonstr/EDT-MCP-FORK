"""
EXTERNAL-OBJECTS project coverage — issue #309.

An EDT project with `V8ExternalObjectsNature` is a THIRD project kind, alongside a base
configuration and a configuration extension. Its roots are its own `ExternalDataProcessor`
/ `ExternalReport` objects, held by the project itself; it has no `Configuration` of its
own, and `IConfigurationProvider.getConfiguration(project)` answers with the BASE
configuration it is linked to — a different project's model entirely.

Every FQN-addressed metadata tool used to resolve against that answer. The result was not
an error but a WRONG one: `get_metadata_objects` listed the base configuration's objects
for the external project, `get_metadata_details` reported "Object not found" for an
external data processor that plainly exists, and `create_metadata` answered "Form not
found" for a form sitting on disk. This file is the regression guard for that whole class:
the tools must answer about THE PROJECT THE CALLER NAMED.

Fixture ground truth (tests/ExternalObjects, base project TestConfiguration):
  ExternalDataProcessor `ExtProc` — attribute `Note` (String 100), form `MainForm`
    (managed, main attribute `Object`, one bound field `Note`);
  ExternalReport `ExtReport` — no members.

Mutation safety: the mutating tests here create and then DELETE what they created through
the tools, and each ends by asserting the fixture path is byte-clean again. They never
touch the base project, so assert_no_diff() (which is scoped to it) holds throughout.
