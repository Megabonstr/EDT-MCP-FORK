"""Black-box contract tests for asynchronous ask_workmate jobs.

ask_workmate ships DISABLED: it hands the question to an external plugin that
reaches a cloud service and can change the configuration with its own tools. So the
default-off contract is what runs everywhere, including CI, and everything that
actually calls the tool is opt-in - on a default server those calls answer with the
shared "disabled by the user" text instead of the behaviour under test.
