e2e tests for compare_configurations (kind: action).

WHAT THE TOOL DOES
------------------
Starts a THREE-WAY comparison of a project's working tree against two git revisions
and reports which top objects differ. It never merges and never writes the project;
what it does change is EDT's own state, because the workbench runs exactly ONE
comparison at a time and this call takes that slot.

RESPONSE SHAPE
--------------
MARKDOWN tool: the payload lands in r.text.
  start, still running: "**Pending:** the comparison continues in background job `<id>`"
                        plus the shared "# Background job: running" snapshot
  start, finished:      "# Background job: done" + "## Result" + "# Comparison: `<project>`"
                        (the project name rides in a code span, so a name carrying a line
                        break cannot end the heading and start blocks of its own)
  error:                {"success": false, "error": "..."} delivered as isError

CI STRATEGY - WHY BOTH REVISIONS ARE "HEAD"
-------------------------------------------
`.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml` checks out with the default `fetch-depth: 1`, so
`HEAD~1` DOES NOT EXIST on CI and any test pinned to real history would fail there and
pass locally. The alternative - manufacturing a commit inside the run - would write to
the very clone the stand imports its fixture from, and a `--filter git` slice has
already moved that clone's HEAD live once. So these tests use `HEAD` for both sides:
it resolves on any clone, shallow or not, it needs no commit, no branch switch and no
tag, and it exercises exactly the contract under test (launch, refusal, cancellation,
error quality). WHAT the tree contains is proved by the unit tests over a stubbed node
set, not here.

The tool is read-only with respect to the project, so assert_no_diff() on every path.

CANCELLATION IS PART OF THE TEST, NOT CLEANUP
---------------------------------------------
Every launched comparison is released before the test returns. A comparison left
alive holds EDT's single slot and its temporary workspace, which would make every
later test in the file - and any later run - fail with "already running".

Releasing takes TWO calls, not one, because the two states need different ones:
`cancel_job` stops a comparison that is still RUNNING, and it cannot end one that has
FINISHED - that job is terminal, so the tool's cancellation handler never runs at all.
A finished comparison is given back with `compare_configurations(releaseComparisonId=...)`.
`_finish()` below does both, which is why no test here calls `_cancel` on its own.
