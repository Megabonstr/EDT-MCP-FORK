#
# Sized at the full CLEAN_ATTEMPTS cycles so that in the ORDINARY failure - clean_project simply
# being refused, settle after settle succeeding - every configured attempt starts with room to
# spare and the budget is never what ends the cycle. It is NOT a promise that the counters always
# win: interleave a settle failure before each refused clean and the time runs out first (with the

# purpose - the counters alone permit CLEAN+SETTLE iterations, roughly twice what the single shared
# budget ever had. What must not happen is that the abort then LIES about it, and it does not:
# _clean_failure_cause names the budget when the budget is what stopped it.
#
# A budget, NOT a hard stop. Neither a settle nor a clean_project can be cancelled once started and

# the split and CLEAN_ATTEMPTS+SETTLE_ATTEMPTS without a budget at all. The pathological case was

#
# The write-metadata cleanup (reset_fixture + reset_model) dominates the whole suite: 331
# tests, ~3560 s, ~11 s each, while the tool call itself is a fraction of a second. Most of
# those tests are NEGATIVE - they hand a write tool a bad argument and assert the refusal -
# and refusing changes nothing, so the clean_project they pay for re-imports a model that
# never moved.
#
# The shortcut is decided on EVIDENCE, never on a guess about what a tool "probably" did:
# after the test the fixture must be git-clean AND the model's top-object inventory must
# equal the snapshot taken before the suite ran. Failing either, the full reset runs. On top
# of that, a test that invoked one of the DEEP tools always pays in full - those mutate
# broadly enough (cascades, cross-object rewrites, whole-configuration import) that an
# unchanged inventory is not evidence of an unchanged model.

# Tools that change the BM model. A SUCCESSFUL call to any of them forfeits the shortcut

# git-clean — and a NESTED change (an attribute added to an existing catalog) leaves the
# top-object inventory identical. Both probes then report "pristine" while the next test
# inherits an in-memory child. A refusal changes nothing, so negative tests — the ones the
# shortcut is actually for — still qualify.
# Kept honest by test_mutation_set_ratchet.py: a tool that extends AbstractMetadataWriteTool on

    Metadata-write tools (create/add/delete/rename metadata) mutate the in-memory BM model
    but do NOT flush every change to disk, so a git reset alone cannot undo them — the model
    would carry the unsaved change into the next test. clean_project re-imports the clean disk
    + revalidates, discarding the in-memory change. The orchestrator calls this after each
    kind='write-metadata' test.

    CRITICAL ORDERING (root cause of the rename >300s e2e timeout): a metadata write also
    SCHEDULES a derived-data recompute, so the project is BUILDING right after the test —
    and clean_project REFUSES a building project. The old code called clean_project FIRST
    and swallowed the refusal (it returns an isError result, not an exception), leaving the
    model UN-reset; the next rename then blocked for minutes inside EDT's still-draining
    derived-data pipeline (DerivedDataManager.blockAsyncPipeline), tripping the per-test
    timeout. So: wait for the project to SETTLE first (out-waiting that recompute) so the
    clean is accepted, THEN clean_project (which itself blocks on its own derived-data
    rebuild). Retry if a late-starting recompute re-flags BUILDING between the wait and the
    call.

    A successful clean_project is NOT that guarantee on its own, which is the second race
    this function has to close. The orchestrator reverts the fixture on disk BEFORE the
    test's model cleanup, but a metadata write's disk export is ASYNC: EDT can flush the
    MUTATED state back out DURING the settle wait, i.e. AFTER that revert — and then
    clean_project faithfully re-imports the mutated disk and still reports ok. Observed on
    EDT 2026.2 (a renamed Catalog survived a green clean_project and the next test failed
    on the baseline FQN). Hence, per attempt: settle FIRST so any lagging export has landed,
    re-revert the disk, THEN clean, and finally VERIFY the baseline is actually back
    (_baseline_is_back) instead of assuming it. Verification — not a longer timeout — is
    what makes this correct: the failure is a lost write-back race, not slowness.

    the claim, so the failure message has to carry the count - a bare

    duplicate" then describes a count of 0 just as readily as a count of 2.

    WHY THE DWELL, and not "return on the first matching read": in the case this exists for, the

    step. A first-sample poll is therefore satisfied by the PRE-call contents and never observes
    what the call did, so a regression that eventually writes a second row would pass. Requiring the
    count to HOLD for `stable_for` closes that: a late duplicate resets the dwell, the count settles
    at 2, `expected` is never reached again and the call fails with the count it actually saw.

    This is a dwell, not a proof that an export happened - the write under test may legitimately be
    a no-op that rewrites nothing, so demanding evidence of a rewrite would fail those cases
    spuriously. Pick `stable_for` longer than the export lag you care about.
