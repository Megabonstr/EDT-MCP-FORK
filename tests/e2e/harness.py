#
# Sized at the full CLEAN_ATTEMPTS cycles so that in the ORDINARY failure - clean_project simply
# being refused, settle after settle succeeding - every configured attempt starts with room to
# spare and the budget is never what ends the cycle. It is NOT a promise that the counters always
# win: interleave a settle failure before each refused clean and the time runs out first (with the
# defaults, 612+922+612+922 = 3068 against a 2766 budget), which is the trade being made on
# purpose - the counters alone permit CLEAN+SETTLE iterations, roughly twice what the single shared
# budget ever had. What must not happen is that the abort then LIES about it, and it does not:
# _clean_failure_cause names the budget when the budget is what stopped it.
#
# A budget, NOT a hard stop. Neither a settle nor a clean_project can be cancelled once started and
# the deadline is only checked where an iteration BEGINS, so the cycle can overrun it by the one
# iteration already under way - worst case CLEAN_ATTEMPTS+1 cycles, against CLEAN_ATTEMPTS before
# the split and CLEAN_ATTEMPTS+SETTLE_ATTEMPTS without a budget at all. The pathological case was

    Metadata-write tools (create/add/delete/rename metadata) mutate the in-memory BM model
    but do NOT flush every change to disk, so a git reset alone cannot undo them - the model
    would carry the unsaved change into the next test. clean_project re-imports the clean disk
    + revalidates, discarding the in-memory change.

    CRITICAL ORDERING (root cause of the rename >300s e2e timeout): a metadata write also
    SCHEDULES a derived-data recompute, so the project is BUILDING right after the test -
    and clean_project REFUSES a building project. An earlier revision called clean_project
    FIRST and swallowed the refusal (it returns an isError result, not an exception), leaving
    the model UN-reset; the next rename then blocked for minutes inside EDT's still-draining
    derived-data pipeline (DerivedDataManager.blockAsyncPipeline), tripping the per-test
    timeout. So: wait for the project to SETTLE first (out-waiting that recompute) so the
    clean is accepted, THEN clean_project (which itself blocks on its own derived-data
    rebuild). Retry if a late-starting recompute re-flags BUILDING between the wait and the
    call.

    A successful clean_project is NOT that guarantee on its own, which is the second race
    this function has to close. The orchestrator reverts the fixture on disk BEFORE the
    test's model cleanup, but a metadata write's disk export is ASYNC: EDT can flush the
    MUTATED state back out DURING the settle wait, i.e. AFTER that revert - and then
    clean_project faithfully re-imports the mutated disk and still reports ok. Observed on
    EDT 2026.2 (a renamed Catalog survived a green clean_project and the next test failed
    on the baseline FQN). Hence, per attempt: settle FIRST so any lagging export has landed,
    re-revert the disk, THEN clean, and finally VERIFY instead of assuming. Verification -
    not a longer timeout - is what makes this correct: the failure is a lost write-back race,

    The COUNT sibling of poll_disk_contains, for the "written exactly once" class of assertion (an

    the claim, so the failure message has to carry the count - a bare
    `read_disk(f).count(x) == n` reports neither the number it saw nor the file, and "must NOT
    duplicate" then describes a count of 0 just as readily as a count of 2.

    WHY THE DWELL, and not "return on the first matching read": in the case this exists for, the
    expected count is ALREADY true before the call under test - the row was written by the previous
    step. A first-sample poll is therefore satisfied by the PRE-call contents and never observes
    what the call did, so a regression that eventually writes a second row would pass. Requiring the
    count to HOLD for `stable_for` closes that: a late duplicate resets the dwell, the count settles
    at 2, `expected` is never reached again and the call fails with the count it actually saw.

    This is a dwell, not a proof that an export happened - the write under test may legitimately be
    a no-op that rewrites nothing, so demanding evidence of a rewrite would fail those cases
    spuriously. Pick `stable_for` longer than the export lag you care about.
