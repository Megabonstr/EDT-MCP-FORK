"""
EDT-MCP e2e orchestrator.

Discovers every @e2e_test in tests/e2e/tools/test_*.py and runs them SERIALLY
(all tests mutate the same TestConfiguration + git tree, so they cannot run in
parallel WITHIN one runner). Resets the fixture before EVERY test, enforces a
clean final state, and emits a JUnit XML report. See SKILL.md.

--shard I/N splits the suite ACROSS runners instead: each shard is an ordinary
serial run of its own subset, on its own machine, with its own workspace and its
own fixture checkout. That is what makes it safe - the isolation comes from not
sharing a working tree, not from locking one. Never point two shards at the same
checkout.

Usage:
    python tests/e2e/run_all.py [--host H] [--port P] [--project NAME]
                                [--junit-xml PATH] [--filter SUBSTR]
                                [--shard I/N]
