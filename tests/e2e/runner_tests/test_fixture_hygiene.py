"""The committed fixtures must not already contain what the suite seeds at runtime.

`run_all.py` ends every run with a "fixture clean" verdict, but that verdict compares the working
tree against HEAD - so an object a run left behind and that then got COMMITTED is, by construction,
"clean". It stays invisible until the test that seeds it fails with "Node already exists", one
shard at a time, on a machine that is not the one that committed it.

The `E2E` prefix separates the two populations: the fixture projects ship no object carrying it,
while the suite's own identifiers use it in the hundreds. So a TRACKED fixture path with an
E2E-prefixed component is a leftover, and naming it here is cheaper than reading a shard log.
