Evaluates a BSL expression in the context of a suspended stack frame and returns its value and type - like a debugger watch/immediate window. Use it to compute or probe things that aren't already sitting in a variable.

## When to use
- You are suspended at a breakpoint and want to evaluate `Object.Property`, a function call, or any BSL expression against the live state.
- Checking a condition or computing a value while paused.

## Parameter details
- `frameRef` (required) - the stable frame reference from `wait_for_break` / `step`; the expression runs in that frame's scope.
- `expression` (required) - the BSL expression text to evaluate.

## What you get
JSON: `type` (the BSL reference type name) and `value` (string form). Long values are truncated, with `truncated: true` and `fullLength`. A BSL evaluation error comes back as an actionable error message.

## Notes & gotchas
- **This executes arbitrary BSL in the running 1C application** - it can have side effects (writes, calls). Treat it like running code, not a pure read.
- **It asks first.** Because the effect of an expression cannot be told from the call, this tool goes through the server's destructive-consent gate (the same one `delete_metadata` uses) on EVERY evaluation: a human at the EDT workbench confirms, and "Allow for this session" makes it one click per EDT run. Unattended runs set `EDT_MCP_DESTRUCTIVE_CONSENT=allow` at launch, or the consent level in MCP Server preferences. On a headless EDT without that variable the call is refused, not silently allowed. The audit line an unattended allow writes records how many characters the expression was, never the expression itself - it may carry a password or a token.
- `frameRef`s go stale after every `step`/`resume`; use the latest one or you'll get "call wait_for_break again".
- Evaluation has a short timeout; a hanging expression returns a timeout error rather than blocking. For just reading existing variables, `get_variables` is cheaper and side-effect-free.
- Some 1C debug models may not support expression evaluation; the tool says so clearly when no watch-expression delegate is registered.
