Returns a YAML snapshot of a form's **calculated WYSIWYG layout**: per-element bounds (x/y/width/height), element types, and display-affecting properties, plus the overall form size. The response type is TEXT (the YAML itself).

## When to use
- Inspect or compare what a form actually lays out (positions, sizes, visibility) rather than its declarative `.form` definition.
- Verify a layout change took effect, or diff two states of the same form.
- For a rendered PNG instead of layout data, use `get_form_screenshot`.

## Render-mode flags (read this first)
No buffered-render JVM flag is required for this tool's element tree or form-level size. Per-element bounds are governed by EDT's **native form layout render mode**, exposed as `nativeFormLayoutRender`:
- Native render **on** (`-DnativeFormLayoutRender=true`, also EDT's default when the property is absent): EDT computes the layout in its C++ visualizer. It does not return per-element rectangles to the Java `modelProjection` / `layoutProjection` / `viewProjection` chain used by this tool, so `elementsWithBounds: 0` is structural rather than a rendering delay. Retrying or using `refresh: true` cannot populate those bounds.
- Native render **off** (`-DnativeFormLayoutRender=false`): EDT populates the Java projections. A zero-bounds result can then mean that the form has not finished rendering; retry or use `refresh: true`.

`-DnativeFormBufferedLayoutRender=true` is a different knob. It enables the offscreen buffered image used by `get_form_screenshot`; it does not make `get_form_layout_snapshot` produce per-element bounds. Use `get_server_status` → `formRenderFlags.nativeFormLayoutRender.atStartup` to see the native mode captured at EDT startup: `on`, `off`, or `unknown`. The layout-snapshot warning itself probes the current live mode; `forcedAtRuntime`, when present in server status, signals that the known live mode no longer matches the known startup snapshot. Do not base the decision on `requested`, which is only the raw system-property value currently set and can be absent. If native rendering is on and you need the form's element hierarchy rather than pixel rectangles, call `get_metadata_details` with the form FQN to inspect the element tree and its nesting.

## Parameter details
- `projectName` - EDT project name. **Required when `formPath` is specified**; omitting it then returns an error. Ignored when targeting the active editor.
- `formPath` - metadata FQN of the form. If given, the tool opens and activates that form automatically. If omitted, the currently active form editor is used.
- `refresh` - force a WYSIWYG refresh before capturing; default `true`. Set `false` to read the last-rendered state without re-laying-out.
- `mode` - `compact` (default) or `full`; an unknown value returns an error.

### formPath format
`MetadataType.ObjectName.Forms.FormName`, or `CommonForm.FormName` for a common form. Examples:
- `Catalog.Products.Forms.ItemForm`
- `Document.SalesOrder.Forms.DocumentForm`
- `CommonForm.MyForm`

## Modes
- `compact` (default) - only visual elements with positive bounds, and only selected display-affecting properties. Best for a readable overview.
- `full` - every layout node (including zero-bounds/structural ones) and all non-containment properties. Verbose; use when you need the complete tree.

## Examples
- Active editor, default compact: `{}`.
- Specific form: `{projectName: "MyProj", formPath: "Catalog.Products.Forms.ItemForm"}`.
- Full tree, no refresh: `{formPath: "CommonForm.MyForm", projectName: "MyProj", mode: "full", refresh: false}`.

## Notes & gotchas
- `formPath` without `projectName` is rejected: "projectName is required when formPath is specified".
- Needs a live workbench Display; runs on the UI thread.
- Read a "No calculated element bounds were found" warning according to its render-mode diagnosis:
  - Native render on: Java-side per-element bounds are not produced. This is structural; do not retry. Relaunching EDT with `-DnativeFormLayoutRender=false` is what produces bounds, but it is a trade-off - native render is the mode `get_form_screenshot`'s image path uses. If you only need the element tree and nesting, use `get_metadata_details` instead.
  - Native render off: the form may not have finished rendering. Retry or ensure `refresh` is `true`.
  - Render mode unknown: the live probe could not read EDT's current render mode, so the warning names both possibilities without choosing one. `get_server_status` reports a separate startup snapshot in `formRenderFlags.*.atStartup`; it may also be `unknown` and must not be replaced with the raw `requested` property. Call `get_metadata_details` with the form FQN to inspect the element tree regardless of render mode. EDT uses native render by default when `-DnativeFormLayoutRender` is not set explicitly, so an installation with no such line is most likely in the structural case.
