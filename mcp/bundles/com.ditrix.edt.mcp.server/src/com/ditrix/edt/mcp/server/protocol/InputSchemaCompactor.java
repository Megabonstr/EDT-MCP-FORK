/**
 * Drops the prose from a tool's {@code inputSchema} parameters before it is serialized
 * into {@code tools/list}, keeping the SHAPE a call is built from — names, types,
 * {@code required}, {@code enum}, {@code default} — and keeping the handful of
 * descriptions that were measured to be load-bearing.
 * <p>
 * <b>Why this reverses a documented decision.</b> {@link OutputSchemaCompactor} states
 * that {@code inputSchema} is deliberately NOT compacted, because "a parameter's
 * description is what the model uses to build a correct call, and removing it produces
 * malformed calls". That was true as measured for #395: on Haiku, stripping parameter
 * prose made the model invent a {@code metadata} key for the role-rights {@code object}
 * key, invent a {@code type} value shape and invent a designer-era module path.
 * <p>
 * Re-measured on Sonnet 5 over 500 requests ({@code tests/tool-choice/}), the result
 * inverts: with the prose stripped and the shape intact, calls got MORE correct, not
 * less — 7 calls missing a required parameter out of 905, against 22 out of 882 with the
 * full prose. What the enum and the default carry is the call; the paragraph around them
 * is what costs tokens. So the decision is reversed for the parameter surface, on the
 * model bar the plugin actually targets, and the tool {@code description} stays in the
 * Java sources as before.
 * <p>
 * <b>What survives, and why it is an allowlist rather than a rule.</b> A few parameter
 * descriptions state a fact the schema cannot express, and dropping them measurably
 * breaks a request: {@code get_markers.markerKind} is the only place that says a
 * {@code task} marker means TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK, and without it "find every FIXME" stops
 * resolving to {@code get_markers} at all. Those are listed in {@link #KEEP}; every other
 * parameter description stops at this wire boundary and lives on in the sources and in
 * {@code get_tool_guide}. A tool added later is stripped by default, which is the
 * measured-correct default.
 * <p>
 * <b>The walk is structural, not textual</b> — see {@link OutputSchemaCompactor} for the
 * full reasoning: this plugin declares properties literally called {@code type} and
 * {@code items}, so property-map KEYS are never read as schema keywords.

     * For such a parameter the description is not prose about the value — it IS the only

     * {@code {"type":"array","items":{"type":"object"}}} and no way to build the call.
     * {@code create_metadata.properties} (members are {@code {name, value, language?}}) and

     * the measured cases: #395 saw exactly this failure on Haiku, where the model invented a
     * {@code metadata} key for the role-rights {@code object} key.
     * <p>
     * This is a structural rule rather than another allowlist entry on purpose: it holds for
     * a tool added later, and it stops holding by itself the moment someone models the
