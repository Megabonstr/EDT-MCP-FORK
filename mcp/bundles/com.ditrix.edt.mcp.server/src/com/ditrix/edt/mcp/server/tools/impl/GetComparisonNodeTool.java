/**
 * Expands ONE node of a running or finished configuration comparison: the three-way property table,
 * the per-side form structure, the module section list, the vendor-support state, the child outline
 * and the POTENTIAL problems the engine recorded. Read-only - it never merges anything.
 *
 * <p>Two behaviours are the reason this tool is not a thin wrapper around a getter.</p>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li><b>The comparison tree is LAZY, in two ways.</b> A node whose
 * {@code ComparisonNodeStatus} is {@code Unfinished} / {@code HasUnfinishedChildren} has an empty
 * or partial child list because the engine has not reached it, NOT because the sides agree - so the
 * tool asks the engine to {@code prioritize} the node and then waits, bounded by
 * {@code waitSeconds}, on THAT NODE's own status. And a node the engine has not built yet is not
 * merely unfinished: it is ABSENT, so the address resolves to nothing at all. Both waits share one
 * budget, and neither absence is reported as a verdict: an expired wait says the subtree is
 * unfinished, and an address that never resolved says whether the tree was still building or the
 * comparison genuinely has no such node. It never renders "no differences" over an uncompared
 * subtree, and never calls a valid object nonexistent because nobody had compared it yet.</li>
 * <li><b>Nodes live in the comparison's OWN BM store.</b> Every node read therefore happens inside
 * {@code ComparisonEngine.read(...)} (which wraps
 * {@code IComparisonSession.runComparisonTreeReadonlyTask}), never inside a project transaction -
 * CLAUDE.md don't #1 applies to the wrong store just as much as to no store at all. No comparison
 * node object is allowed to escape that boundary: the first read returns node IDs, the second read
 * renders.</li>
 * </ol>

     * one - and the port is the only place that can still tell them apart, because only there is

     * ready-made is what stops the difference being lost on the way to the caller, and it also
     * keeps these two out of the generic failure branch, whose advice ("start a new one") is
     * wrong for the retryable one.
