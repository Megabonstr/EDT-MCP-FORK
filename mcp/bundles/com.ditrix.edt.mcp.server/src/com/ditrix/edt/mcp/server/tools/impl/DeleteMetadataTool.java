     * Queues the export of the container the delete just emptied - the SUBMIT half of "submit, then

     * <p>
     * The export barrier this tool inherits only WAITS. A wait is ordered with an export only when
     * the same call put that export in the queue: {@code create_metadata} and the four specialized
     * delete branches call {@code forceExportToDisk} and only then let the barrier run, so by the
     * time they answer, nothing of THEIRS is still queued. (Which is all a drained queue ever
     * proves - the platform logs a per-file write failure and completes the computation anyway, so
     * "drained" never means "the bytes are right".) This branch left the scheduling to EDT's
     * md-refactoring, and the barrier's probe of the export segment could therefore answer "quiet"
     * truthfully and uselessly - observed on run 31728870176: the object's own {@code .mdo} already
     * gone, {@code Configuration.mdo} not yet rewritten, and no barrier-failure marker in the log.
     * Submitting here restores the ordering by construction instead of by timing luck.
     * <p>
     * Two things it deliberately does NOT do, because the platform cannot be asked for them:
     * <ul>
     * <li>the deleted object's OWN {@code .mdo} (or its removal) is not resubmitted - EDT builds a
     * save task by looking the FQN up in the transaction, so an FQN that no longer resolves yields
     * no task at all. That file stays scheduled by the refactoring alone;</li>
     * <li>the cascade's other files - referring objects cleaned in this project, and any dependent
     * extension - are not submitted either. Naming them would mean re-exporting an unbounded set
     * inside one deadline, and a false REFUSAL on a healthy delete costs more than a miss. That
     * boundary is issue #408's, and the tool reporting what it actually wrote is the maintainer's
     * call, not something to be inferred here.
     * </ul>
     * A refusal or a {@link RuntimeException} never becomes a failed delete - the model change
     * already happened, and answering "delete failed" would be a worse lie than answering late. It
     * is REPORTED instead: the caller is told which file may lag, and the log carries the reason.
     * That is also why the submission is wrapped here rather than left to the caller's catch block:
     * an exception thrown on the way to queueing an export says nothing about whether the delete
     * succeeded. An {@link Error} is deliberately NOT caught and reaches the caller's handler - a
     * JVM-level failure is not a fact about this export.
     *
     * @param project the project owning the container
     * @param containerFqn the container's top-object FQN, or {@code null} when it could not be named

     *
     * <p>The radius is DERIVED, not listed: {@code EcoreUtil.remove} takes the whole containment
     * subtree, so every containment reference of the object's EClass is followed - many-valued and
     * single-valued alike. Naming the features to follow ({@code items}, {@code columns}, plus the
     * singular containments that hold a {@code FormItem}) left out the two containments that hold
     * something else: an element's {@code handlers} list and a command's {@code action}. Both go with
     * their owner, so deleting a field, a button or a command was authorized and previewed as "one
     * member" while it silently carried off the procedure binding (issue #295 review).</p>
     *
     * <p>What gets REPORTED is likewise a property, not a list: a contained object that carries its
     * own non-empty {@code name} is a member the caller can address and therefore loses (a nested
     * item, an attribute column, an event handler, a command's action handler); one that carries none
     * is a property holder of its owner (a data path, a title, an extInfo, a type description) and is
     * descended THROUGH, not listed - which is how a command's action, an unnamed container, still
     * yields the named {@code CommandHandler} inside it.</p>
     *
     * <p>Only the PERSISTED containments are followed - a derived / transient one is skipped, again
     * by asking EMF rather than by naming classes. It matters on the form ROOT: a content form also
     * contains its DERIVED data (the form-data structure of every attribute, the BSL context with its
     * types, properties, methods, parameters and events, the standard commands, the ChildItems
     * views). None of that is authored, none of it is written to {@code Form.form}, and it is
     * recomputed after any edit - counting it turned a 15-member form into a 450-entry prompt when
     * this walk first replaced the old one. What a delete really costs the caller is what was
     * persisted (found by the live probe of this round).</p>
     *
     * <p>The traversal is an explicit stack, not recursion: a {@code StackOverflowError} is an
     * {@link Error} that no {@code catch (Exception)} above would stop. The
     * {@link FormStructureReader#MAX_NODES} bound counts VISITS, not matches, so a subtree full of
     * unnamed property holders cannot walk unboundedly while this claims a cap.</p>
