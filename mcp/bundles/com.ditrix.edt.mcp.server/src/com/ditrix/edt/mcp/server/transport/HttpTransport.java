     * byte string, the JDK's own {@code HttpClient} refuses it, and Python's {@code http.client}
     * fails to encode it. A Cyrillic token is therefore not a credential anybody can present,
     * however configured it looks, and the endpoint stays locked with nothing on screen to say
     * why. That is the case this check exists for.</li>
     * <li>A bare CR or LF, which every HTTP client blocks outright because it splits the request
     * - header injection, not a credential.</li>

     * Everything else stays in, INCLUDING things no careful client would send. Latin-1
     * round-trips with the clients this page hands a config to ({@code fetch} and Python
     * {@code requests} serialise a header value as ISO-8859-1, which is how the JDK's server
     * decodes it back), and a control byte is passed through by Python's {@code http.client},
     * which blocks only CR and LF - the listener then compares the very same character. Both
     * would be refused by SOME clients and accepted by others, and "some clients cannot use
     * this" is a different claim from "no client can". Only the second belongs in a warning
     * whose advice is to replace the credential; the first belongs in the README, where it is.
