     * NOT added to every stored list the way {@code git} is - only to a list that already CONTAINS

     * Version 6 is the version 2 case again, one tool generation later: a stored read-only profile
     * is recognized by CONTAINMENT of its frozen shape - never by equality, which would miss the
     * ordinary user who tightened the preset further - and gains the two destructive tools it
     * could not have excluded. {@code merge_rules} did not exist when the profile was saved;
     * {@code delete_project} did, but it lives in a group no preset disables and was never named
     * by hand, so no stored read-only profile has it. Neither is re-added to a profile that
     * already carries it, and a selection that merely OVERLAPS a shape is left alone.
     * <p>
     * Version 4 repairs stored preset shapes after previously ungrouped tools joined groups that
     * those presets disable. It recognizes an older preset by containment of the frozen historical
     * shape, which omits both names the store may predate and default-disabled names the user may
     * intentionally have enabled. Because the recognized shapes are nested, it tests the most
     * restrictive shape first; otherwise a broader match would add only part of the tools owed to
