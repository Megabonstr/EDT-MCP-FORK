/**
 * Turns a platform failure into a message a caller can actually read.
 *
 * <h2>Why</h2>
 * EDT reports failures as {@link IStatus} objects and only then wraps them in exceptions, so
 * {@code getMessage()} — what tools naturally concatenate into an error — is frequently the
 * LEAST informative part of the failure:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code new ApplicationException(status)} takes {@code status.getMessage()}, which is the
 *       EMPTY STRING for a cancellation ({@code Status.CANCEL_STATUS}); the tool then emits a
 *       sentence that stops at the colon;</li>
 *   <li>a wrapper status often carries a generic message while the real reason sits in a CHILD
 *       status (EDT builds {@code MultiStatus} results) or in the status's own exception;</li>
 *   <li>an exception whose message is {@code null} renders as the literal "null".</li>
 * </ul>
 * All three read as "the tool broke" rather than "the platform refused, and here is why".
 *
 * <h2>What it does</h2>
 * {@link #describe(Throwable)} walks the failure — the exception chain, and for each hop the
 * {@link IStatus} it carries (failing children first, then other children, its message, and its
 * own exception) — and
 * returns the first non-blank message it finds. When the whole failure genuinely carries no text
 * it says so, naming the exception type and the status severity, because "CANCEL, no message" is
 * itself the diagnosis: something aborted the operation rather than failing it.
 *
 * <p>{@link #rootCause(Throwable)} answers a separate, complementary question: after
 * {@code describe} has selected the headline, what does the deepest distinct bounded
 * {@code getCause()} hop say? Child statuses are aggregate detail and are interpreted only by the
 * per-hop selection rule at their owning throwable. Callers that need both compose them explicitly;
 * the root-cause helper does not change {@code describe}'s established selection rule or invent an
 * ordering among aggregate statuses.
 *
 * <p>{@link #withoutObjectIdentity(String)} answers a SEPARATE question and is meant to be
 * COMPOSED with {@code describe}, never substituted for it. {@code describe} selects the most
 * informative message the failure carries, and that selection is exactly why it cannot cure a
 * leaking one: for the platform's "Failed to persist reference value
 * com...RoleDescriptionImpl@3f2a1b" the most informative message IS the message that leaks an
 * implementation object's identity. Choosing a different message would throw the diagnosis
 * away; choosing that one keeps the heap address. Selecting the text and cleaning the text are
 * two questions, answered by two methods, in that order.
 *
 * <p>Pure and side-effect-free (logging stays with the caller, which knows the context), so the
 * whole decision is unit-testable without an EDT runtime.

     *
     * <p><b>What makes this safe to run over arbitrary prose is the RIGHT-HAND BOUNDARY, not a
     * floor on the hash length.</b> A length floor is wrong in both directions at once. It is too
     * NARROW upwards: the hash is {@code Integer.toHexString(hashCode())}, which is one to eight
     * digits, so a floor of four silently lets a real
     * {@code RoleDescriptionImpl@abc} through. And it is too WIDE downwards, because length says
     * nothing about whether the hex run is a hash at all: in "john@face.book" the four letters
     * "face" are every one of them hex digits, and a floor-only pattern matches "john@face" and
     * hands the caller back the corrupted "john.book".
     *
     * <p>A real identity's hex run is TERMINAL - the object's {@code toString()} ends there, so
     * what follows is the end of the text or a separator, never the continuation of a name. That
     * is what the two lookaheads assert: the run may not be followed by another name character,
     * and may not be followed by a dot that itself continues into one (which is exactly the shape
     * of a domain, a package tail or a file extension). Both halves are needed - the first alone
     * still eats "john@face" out of "john@face.book"; the second alone still eats "user@e" out of
     * "user@example.com".
     *
     * <p>Because the boundary carries the safety, the hash may be as short as ONE digit. The
     * knowing cost of that is a bare "X@1" - a legal, if unusual, identity rendering - being
     * scrubbed to "X" wherever it is genuinely something else.

     * its own contributes no cause clause, even when its children carry one.
