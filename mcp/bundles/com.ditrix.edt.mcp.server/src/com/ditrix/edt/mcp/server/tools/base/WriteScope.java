/**
 * What a single write call says about WHERE it wrote - stated by the call itself, while it runs.
 * <p>
 * The export barrier used to ask this question AFTERWARDS, of the tool's arguments and of the JSON
 * it had already produced, and every tool answered it with a different indirect signal: the
 * extension name read back out of its own result, the position of the marker it fixed, its own
 * report counters, the {@code confirm} argument. None of those is a statement about a write; each
 * new writing tool was a fresh chance to guess wrong in either direction - waiting for a project
 * nothing was queued in refuses a healthy call, and not waiting for the one that was answers "done"
 * over an unfinished disk. Issue #408.
 * <p>
 * <b>The statement is a by-product of doing the write, not a second thing to remember.</b> Every
 * export this plugin submits goes through one call -
 * {@code BmTransactions.forceExportToDisk} - and that call records the project here. A tool that
 * submits an export therefore declares by submitting. The explicit methods exist only for what that
 * choke point cannot see: a branch that wrote but had no FQN to submit, the platform's own cascade,
 * a success that queued nothing, and a write whose reach the platform will not report.
 * <p>
 * <b>What the choke point cannot see</b>, stated so the guarantee is not read wider than it is: the
 * exports the PLATFORM schedules for itself - the BM reactor after a write transaction commits,
 * EDT's md-refactoring inside a delete or a rename, the adoption service's own BM task - never pass
 * through our helper. They are unobservable from here, which is why {@link #cascadedInto(IProject)}
 * exists and why it is graded differently from a write we performed ourselves.
 * <p>
 * <b>Two grades, and the grade decides whether a stalled queue may REFUSE the call.</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li>a project this call WROTE in (a submitted export, or {@link #wrote(IProject)} when the write
 * queued no export of its own) is waited for and a queue that will not drain refuses - the same
 * verdict the barrier has always reached, now for the right project;</li>
 * <li>a project the platform's cascade MAY have written in ({@link #cascadedInto(IProject)}) is
 * waited for but can never refuse: we never went near that project's export path, so a stall there
 * is somebody else's news. This is what lets a delete cascade be awaited at all without
 * reintroducing the false refusal that awaiting the scanned-but-untouched set would cause.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>"Nothing" and "unknown" are different, at every layer.</b> {@link #queuedNothing()} is a
 * finding - this call put nothing in the queue. Saying nothing at all is an absence of knowledge, and
 * {@link #undeterminable(String, Collection)} is a third thing again: a decision that the platform
 * does not report what was touched. They must never collapse into one value, because the barrier owes
 * a different answer to each and because publishing "I wrote nowhere" for a call that simply could
 * not tell is the over-claim this whole issue is about.
 * <p>
 * Order of statements does not matter, and the precedence is
 * record &gt; {@link #undeterminable(String, Collection)} &gt; {@link #queuedNothing()} &gt; silence.
 * A record wins because it is the hardest fact available; between the other two the safe reading is
 * the one that waits more and claims less, so a call that contradicted itself by stating both is
 * read as "I cannot tell". That is what makes a tool safe to write in
 * the obvious way - {@code resync_to_disk} may report "nothing to export" and only then have its
 * dangling-reference cleanup export {@code Configuration.mdo}; the later record simply wins.
 * <p>
 * Instances are confined to one call. The base class binds one to the thread that runs
 * {@code executeOnUiThread} and restores the previous binding afterwards, so a nested tool call -
 * reachable, because the consent dialog and {@code resync_to_disk} both pump nested SWT event loops
 * in which another request's UI runnable can run - records into its own scope and gives the outer one
 * back.
