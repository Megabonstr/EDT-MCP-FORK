/**
 * The ONE place in this bundle that talks to EDT's comparison engine.
 *
 * <h2>What it is for</h2>
 * EDT drives configuration comparison through {@code IComparisonManager}, an interface that can
 * both COMPARE and MERGE. This facade exposes the comparing half and never hands the manager — or
 * the {@code IComparisonSession} behind it — to a caller. That is not decoration: it is the second
 * of the three independent layers that make merging impossible here.
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@code MANIFEST.MF} does not import {@code com._1c.g5.v8.dt.compare.merge} or
 *       {@code com._1c.g5.v8.dt.compare.git.merge}, so OSGi cannot load those classes at all — not
 *       even reflectively.</li>
 *   <li>No tool ever receives {@code IComparisonManager}. It is not even held here: the private
 *       backend below resolves it per call from a supplier {@code EdtServices} hands in, and the
 *       only field of that type in the whole bundle is that class's service tracker. Its merging
 *       entry points are not reachable through {@link Backend}, which is the only shape the rest of
 *       this class can see.</li>
 *   <li>{@code NoMergeStarterRatchetTest} fails the build if the names of those entry points appear
 *       ANYWHERE under the bundle source root — a comment counts — pins the set of files allowed to
 *       name {@code IComparisonManager} and {@code IComparisonSession}, and fails on a platform
 *       rule-setting call in ANY of them.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * <b>This facade never writes to a comparison.</b> Every operation below either asks the engine
 * a question or governs a comparison's LIFETIME (start, prioritise, cancel, stop); none of them
 * changes what the comparison says. Merge decisions are recorded into EDT's merge-rules FILE by
 * {@code merge_rules}, and the platform re-applies that file when a comparison is launched with
 * it — so nothing here needs the session's rule-setting call, and the ratchet's allow-list for
 * that call is EMPTY rather than "this file only".
 *
 * <h2>Constraints this facade encodes (measured, not assumed)</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>One comparison per EDT instance.</b> {@code ComparisonManager} asserts that no batch is
 *       already active, so a second launch does not queue — it fails. Callers ask
 *       {@link #hasActiveComparison()} first and refuse honestly, naming the live comparison and
 *       how to end it (see {@code ComparisonFailures}).</li>
 *   <li><b>{@link ComparisonProcessStatus} has no failure literal.</b> A failed comparison keeps
 *       reporting whatever phase it reached; the only evidence is
 *       {@code CompareMergeProcessBatch.getFailureCause()}. {@link #progress} therefore reads the
 *       failure FIRST and lets it override the status, so a poll loop that uses it cannot report a
 *       dead comparison as "still running".</li>
 *   <li><b>A status that could not be read is not a status.</b> EDT's manager answers nothing when
 *       it no longer holds the handle's session, and the read itself can throw. Either way
 *       {@link #progress} answers {@link Phase#UNKNOWN} and carries the read failure, rather than
 *       folding the absence into a phase — a caller that quotes it as a platform literal is
 *       putting words in EDT's mouth, and one that treats it as terminal kills a live
 *       comparison over a single unlucky tick.</li>
 *   <li><b>The tree is lazy.</b> Reading a node the engine has not compared yet yields an empty
 *       child list that renders as "no differences". Call {@link #prioritize} and wait on the
 *       NODE's own status ({@link ComparisonView#topNodeStatus}) before reading it.</li>
 *   <li><b>The tree is in the COMPARISON's BM store</b>, not the project's, so
 *       {@code BmTransactions.read(project, …)} is the wrong boundary (CLAUDE.md don't #1). Use
 *       {@link #read(ComparisonView, String, BmTransactions.BmOperation)}.</li>
 *   <li><b>A session is not a job.</b> Its resources — a virtual project and a private BM store —
 *       are given back only by {@link #cancel}/{@link #stop}, so {@link ComparisonSessionRegistry}
 *       owns the lifetime rather than any background-job record. The registry reclaims expired
 *       sessions from its own lookups, so every comparison-tool call sweeps and no call site has to
 *       remember to; with no comparison tool called again, the last session is released when the
 *       bundle stops ({@link #uninstall()}) and not before — there is no timer.</li>
 * </ul>

     * refusal for a launch, and {@link SlotHandback.Verdict#UNREACHABLE} for a hand-back, which is
     * the verdict that keeps the session registered so the attempt can be repeated - so naming the

     * <p>
     * It is deliberately NOT thrown by the reading calls: a poll loop that died on one unlucky
     * tick would end a healthy comparison. They say the same thing without throwing, through
     * {@link PlatformAnswer} - which exists because answering {@code null}/empty instead made "we
     * could not ask" indistinguishable from "we asked and there is nothing there", and a consumer

     * BEFORE {@link Backend#restoreMergeSettings} is called, so the platform is never asked and
     * the launch that would have taken EDT's single comparison slot never happens.
     *
     * <h2>The check and the restore read ONE snapshot, not the same path twice</h2>
     * They used to be two independent opens of the caller's path: this method validated the file
     * and closed it, and the platform then opened the path again. A process that replaced the file
     * in between got a comparison that restored NOTHING and said nothing about it - which is the
     * exact failure the check exists to prevent, walked straight past the check. So a zip is
     * copied to a private temporary first, and both the check and the platform read THAT.
     * <p>
     * <b>Handing the platform a different path is safe, and it is the file NAME that says so.</b>
     * Measured from {@code ComparisonManager} bytecode ({@code com._1c.g5.v8.dt.compare} 29.0.0,
     * EDT 2026.2.0): {@code deserializeMergeSettings} asserts only that the extension is
     * {@code zip} and then hands the string to {@code deserializeMergeSettingsFromZipFile}, which
     * opens it with {@code new ZipFile(path)} and matches each entry against
     * {@code getComparisonSessionStringId(handle)} - computed from the HANDLE's three descriptors,
     * with nothing in it read from the file's name or its directory. The temporary therefore keeps
     * the {@code .zip} extension and nothing else about the caller's path matters. The same
     * measurement says the archive is read to the end inside that method - the settings are
     * deserialized while the {@code ZipFile} is still open and it is closed before the return - so
     * deleting the temporary once the call comes back cannot take anything away from the caller.
     * <p>
     * <b>The snapshot holds ONE entry - the one this comparison restores from.</b> It used to be a
     * byte-for-byte copy of the whole archive, which put no bound at all on what a launch copied
     * into the system temporary directory: a valid archive holding this comparison's small
     * settings entry beside a multi-gigabyte unrelated one was duplicated in full before anything
     * was looked up, and the codec's document and entry-count bounds do not cover a raw copy. The
     * platform reads exactly one entry - measured above - so the copy is now of exactly that entry,
     * and the snapshot's size is the size of what will actually be read. The entry itself is
     * bounded by {@link MergeRulesCodec#MAX_DOCUMENT_BYTES}, which is the same ceiling this server
     * puts on a merge-rules document everywhere else it reads or writes one.
     * <p>
     * <b>"Not read" and "not snapshotted" are DIFFERENT answers, and collapsing them would walk
     * round the bound.</b> An archive this process could not open or read is one nothing was
     * learnt about: the caller's own path goes to the platform, which opens it with its own
     * {@code ZipFile} and fails the launch naming their file - a refusal invented here would be
     * about an archive this code never managed to look at. But a snapshot that could not be TAKEN
     * - no room for the temporary, a write that failed, an entry past the bound - is not that: it
     * is this server establishing that it cannot deliver what the snapshot promises. Falling back
     * to the caller's path there would restore from a file nothing checked, which is the very race
     * the snapshot exists to close, and it would make the bound above unenforceable by simply
     * exceeding it. Such a launch is REFUSED, and the refusal names what could not be done.
     * <p>
     * Only a zip is examined, and only a zip is copied. An {@code .xml} file is the document
     * itself and carries no address, so there is nothing to disprove about it, nothing to be
     * disproved of by a replacement, and its path through here is unchanged. That is a statement
     * about ADDRESSING and not about readability: EDT 2026.2 refuses an {@code .xml} rules file
     * outright ({@code Can read merge settings from a zip file}), which is a loud failure from the
     * platform itself and needs no help from here - see {@link MergeRulesCodec}.

     * and a caller handed "could not read /tmp/edt-mcp-merge-rules1234.zip" has been told about a

     * Copies the ONE entry this comparison restores from into a private temporary, so that what is
     * CHECKED and what the platform RESTORES are one file rather than one path read twice.
     * <p>
     * The temporary keeps the {@code .zip} extension because the platform asserts on it, and
     * carries nothing else of the caller's path - see {@link #restoreMergeSettings} for the
     * measurement that says nothing else is read from it. It holds one entry under the source's own
     * name, which is what makes it the same archive as far as EDT's lookup is concerned and what
     * makes its size proportional to what is actually read.
     * <p>
     * <b>The three answers are not interchangeable.</b> Nothing to snapshot (not a zip) and nothing
     * READ (an archive that could not be opened) both answer {@link ZipSnapshot#none()}, which
     * claims nothing and leaves the caller's own path to the platform. An archive that WAS read and
     * either holds nothing for this comparison or holds an entry that could not be copied answers
     * {@link ZipSnapshot#refused}: the first is the silent no-op this check exists against, and the
     * second is this server unable to keep the promise the copy makes - and falling back there
     * would restore from an archive nothing checked.
     * <p>
     * <b>The rule the branches below follow, in one sentence: the PROBE is the line - until it has
     * accepted the archive an unreadable source has established nothing and is left to the
     * platform, and once it has, every failure to snapshot that archive refuses and names what
     * happened.</b> The line is the probe and not the temporary's creation, because what separates
     * the two answers is whether anything was READ, and the probe is the first statement that
     * reads.
     *
     * <h2>The SOURCE is read before the temporary is made, so the answer follows the evidence</h2>
     * The temporary used to be created first, and the copy - the first statement that touched
     * the source at all - ran after it. A temp area with no room therefore answered
     * {@link ZipSnapshot#refused} for an archive this process had never tried to open: when
     * that archive was itself missing or corrupt the honest answer was
     * {@link ZipSnapshot#none()}, and the caller got a refusal decided by which statement
     * happened to run first rather than by anything read. The distinction above is the whole
     * point of this method, so it is not left to statement order: the source is read FIRST,
     * and only an archive that opened and holds this comparison's entry ever causes a
     * temporary to exist.
     * <p>
     * That costs one extra open of the source on the way through. It is the cheap half of the
     * work - the walk reads the central directory {@code ZipFile} has already validated on
     * open and stops at the first match, while the entry itself is still inflated exactly
     * once, by the copy - and it buys an archive that holds nothing for this comparison a
     * refusal with no temporary created for it at all.
     * <p>
     * The probe does not decide the outcome, and deliberately so: what the archive holds is
     * read off the COPY, so a file replaced between the two opens is still caught by the check
     * below rather than by the probe's stale answer. The probe answers one question only -
     * whether the source could be read.
     *
