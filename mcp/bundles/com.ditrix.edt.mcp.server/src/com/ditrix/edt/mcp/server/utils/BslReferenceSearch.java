/**
 * Runs the Xtext BSL reference finder over the target project and every open EDT project that depends
 * on it. The SEARCH dependency set includes both configuration extensions and linked external-object
 * projects because either can contain BSL references to the base configuration. This is deliberately
 * broader than the extension-only REFACTORING cascade/adopted-target set: external-object projects
 * reference base objects but do not adopt configuration objects.
 * <p>
 * Source URIs come from the Xtext index itself, so the scope stays aligned with every resource kind the
 * finder knows instead of guessing from a workspace file walk.
 * <p>
 * Extension sources cover two distinct cases. Searching them for the base EObject URI remains a
 * precaution: an adopted object has its own URI, so no direct cross-project BSL reference to that base
 * URI was observed in the fixture. The caller also adds adopted-copy URIs as targets, however, and the
 * fixture deliberately proves that an extension BSL usage of such a copy is found in this source scope.
 * <p>
 * The adopted-target extension set is derived from the SAME dependency snapshot as the source scope.
 * It is therefore a subset of the projects whose indexed resources are searched by construction: an
 * adopted target URI can never be paired with a scope that excludes its owning extension.
 * <p>
 * The scope optimization fails CLOSED: unless dependency discovery completes, every scoped project is
 * ready, and every indexed URI can be classified as either a workspace resource or a known
 * non-workspace resource, this helper calls {@link IReferenceFinder#findAllReferences} exactly as the
 * previous implementation did. Membership and readiness are captured before index enumeration and
 * re-captured afterward; an observable change discards the scoped result. This is change DETECTION,
 * not an atomic snapshot.
 * <p>
 * The scoped URI set itself is enumerated twice in immediate succession through the same index path.
 * A difference detects resource movement between the passes, including an open-close-open project
 * transition that removed or restored indexed resources while the endpoint project snapshots agree.
 * This still does NOT make enumeration and the subsequent search atomic: a change entirely after the
 * second pass, or one that reverses within either single pass (or otherwise leaves both collected sets
 * identical), remains undetected. The Xtext index API available here exposes no generation/version
 * signal with which to establish anything stronger.
 * <p>
 * A successful fallback is therefore complete on the SOURCE side. A changed shared snapshot can still
 * make caller-supplied adopted TARGETS incomplete, which the returned stability signal preserves for
 * strict callers. This is load-bearing for {@code delete_metadata}: silently searching a partial source
 * or target set could turn a real reference into "no references" and leave it dangling. A slow complete
 * result is strictly preferable to a fast partial result, so the fallback must not be removed or
 * replaced with a partial scoped call.
