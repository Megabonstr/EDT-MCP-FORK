/**
 * Resolves an MCP {@code projectName} argument to a workspace {@link IProject}
 * and exposes the existence/open predicates that the project tools previously
 * inlined as
 * {@code ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace().getRoot().getProject(name)} followed by
 * {@code exists()} / {@code isOpen()} checks.
 * <p>
 * Besides resolution, this class owns the <b>standard "project not found"
 * message</b> via {@link #notFoundMessage(String)} — a single actionable wording
 * (names the value AND points at {@code list_projects}) that tools use instead of
 * inlining {@code "Project not found: " + name}, so the not-found error reads the
 * same everywhere. A tool still chooses WHICH checks to apply ({@link #exists()}
 * vs {@link #isOpen()}) and its own wording for the distinct "project is closed"
 * case; only the not-found message and the lookup-and-check boilerplate are shared.
 * <p>
 * Beyond {@link IProject} resolution this also resolves the live
 * {@link Configuration} via {@link #resolveConfiguration()} /
 * {@link #resolveConfiguration(String)} — the read tools' shared
 * {@code IConfigurationProvider.getConfiguration(project)} block, with the same
 * actionable errors. Follow-up (card {@code introduce-project-context-resolver}):
 * extend with cached {@code IV8Project} + BM model-manager resolution so tools
 * stop repeating that chain too. That part works against the live BM model and
 * must be introduced incrementally with end-to-end validation.
 *
 * @see ProjectStateChecker for the complementary readiness (building / derived
 *      data) check.
