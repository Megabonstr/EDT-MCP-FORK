/**
 * Resolves the Markdown description of an EDT validation check, by its symbolic dash-cased id.
 * <p>
 * The descriptions SHIP WITH THE PLUGIN as {@code checks/<id>.md} bundle resources, so
 * get_check_description answers - and get_project_errors reports {@code hasDocumentation} -
 * out of the box, with nothing to download and nothing to configure (#31). The
 * {@code mcpChecksFolder} preference is kept as an OVERRIDE for operators who write their own
 * descriptions or translate them: a folder is consulted FIRST and wins per file, so overriding
 * one check does not hide the other 167.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The bundle lookup mirrors {@link GuideLoader} (and the {@code icons/} pattern): the bundle is
 * resolved via {@link FrameworkUtil} and the entry read with {@link Bundle#getEntry(String)},
 * which resolves for both an exploded dev/test bundle and a packaged jar; without a bundle
 * (a plain-classpath unit test) it falls back to the class loader.

     * the body to make it one is the wrong trade: it would serve an operator the text they had
     * just replaced. The shipped descriptions, which cannot change while the plugin runs, carry
     * no such caveat.
