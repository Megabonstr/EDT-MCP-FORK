/**
 * One holder per file path, so that a read-modify-write of that file cannot interleave with
 * another one in this process.
 *
 * <h2>The hazard it closes</h2>
 * Updating a file at one path is three steps - read it, apply the change in memory, write the
 * result back - and only the last of them is atomic on the filesystem. Two calls that update
 * the same file at the same time therefore both read the SAME starting document, and each
 * writes its own change over the other's: one caller's work disappears and both reports say it
 * was recorded.
 * A "the file must not already exist" reservation does not cover this at all - here the file
 * exists legitimately, which is the whole point of an update.
 *
 * <h2>Why a map and not a lock per call</h2>
 * The interval being protected is keyed by the FILE, not by the caller: two calls collide only
 * when they name the same path. A single global lock would serialise unrelated files, and a lock
 * created per call would serialise nothing.
 *
 * <h2>Why the entries are counted</h2>
 * A map that only ever grows is a leak keyed by every path this server has written. Each holder
 * counts the callers that have asked for it and removes itself when the last one leaves, so the
 * map is the size of the work in flight rather than of the work ever done. The count is
 * maintained under the map's own monitor, which is never held while a caller waits for the lock -
 * so a long write blocks the callers of ITS path and nobody else.
 *
 * <h2>What it does NOT do</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Nothing across processes.</b> This is a lock in this JVM. Another EDT, or a person with
 * a text editor, can still write the file between a holder's read and its write.</li>
 * <li><b>Nothing across spellings.</b> The key is the path as given - callers pass an absolute,
 * normalised one - so the same file reached through a symbolic link, a junction, or a different
 * case on a case-insensitive filesystem is a DIFFERENT key. Resolving to the file's real identity
 * needs the file to exist, which it does not for a fresh write.</li>
 * <li><b>It is not a file lock,</b> and it does not outlive the call that took it.</li>
 * </ul>
