/**
 * What became of EDT's single comparison slot, and the sentence the caller publishes about it.
 *
 * <h2>The defect family this type ends</h2>
 * EDT runs ONE comparison per instance. Giving that slot back is two facts and one action, and the
 * two facts used to be re-derived at every site that ended a comparison - the poll loop's failed
 * branch, its cancelled branch, its terminal branch, the {@code cancel_job} handler, the
 * {@code releaseComparisonId} entry point and the idle sweep. Each of them combined the same three
 * questions in its own way:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>could the platform be ASKED at all ({@link PlatformAnswer})?</li>
 *   <li>did the hand-back COMPLETE?</li>
 *   <li>who owed the stop in the first place?</li>
 * </ol>
 * Three review rounds found nine, then eight, then six instances of the same mistake, each in a
 * different one of those sites: an answer discarded, a record dropped over a stop that never
 * happened, a service gap read as a failure. Patching them one at a time produced a new instance
 * per new call site, because the DECISION was the thing being duplicated.
 *
 * <h2>What replaces it</h2>
 * One owner - {@link ComparisonSessionRegistry#handBack(String, Ending)} - performs the whole
 * hand-back and answers with this value. Nothing else in the bundle can end a comparison:
 * {@link ComparisonEngine}'s two lifetime verbs are package-scoped and the session map is private,
 * so a caller has no way to drop a record, and no way to stop a comparison, other than through the
 * owner. What a caller may do with the answer is bounded to three things, none of which is a
 * judgement about the slot: publish {@link #sentence()} verbatim, branch on {@link #slotIsFree()},
 * and notice {@link #wasRegistered()}.
 *
 * <h2>The invariant that makes "forgetting" unrepresentable</h2>
 * <b>The record is dropped exactly when the slot is CONFIRMED free.</b> Never otherwise. A
 * comparison whose hand-back did not complete, or could not even be attempted, stays registered -
 * so it is still named by a refusal, still retried by the next sweep, and still addressable by
 * {@code releaseComparisonId}. There is therefore no state in which a caller holds a dropped
 * record and an occupied slot, which is what every one of the six findings produced in its own
 * way. A caller cannot "forget to account for a failed release" because it never sees the release:
 * it sees this value, and the failure is already written into the sentence it must publish.
 *
 * <h2>What this type does NOT guarantee</h2>
 * Stated here rather than left to be discovered, because the boundary was declared before the work
 * started and the remainder is architecture rather than a missing branch:
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Nothing retries on its own.</b> {@link Verdict#UNREACHABLE} and
 *       {@link Verdict#NOT_FREED} keep the record so the hand-back CAN be retried, but the retry
 *       rides on the next call that touches the registry - there is no timer and no thread. A
 *       workbench where nobody calls a comparison tool again keeps the session until the bundle
 *       stops.</li>
 *   <li><b>Liveness is a reading, not a subscription.</b> "EDT still holds this handle" is
 *       {@code getHandles} answered at one instant. Between the reading and the stop, a workbench
 *       cancellation or an EDT session restart can end the comparison; the hand-back then reports
 *       what it observed, which is one reading old.</li>
 *   <li><b>A lease keeps the SWEEP off a session, not a caller.</b>
 *       {@link ComparisonSessionRegistry#lease(String)} exists so a long tree read is not
 *       reclaimed under itself. It deliberately does not block {@code releaseComparisonId} or
 *       {@code cancel_job}: those are somebody ASKING, and a read that dies because the caller
 *       ended the comparison fails with the platform's own message, which is the truth.</li>
 *   <li><b>When the platform is already gone, nothing is handed back at all.</b> The bundle's
 *       last act asks EDT once more; if EDT's comparison service has been unregistered first - an
 *       EDT shutdown that stops the compare bundle before ours, or a crash - every session answers
 *       {@link Verdict#UNREACHABLE}, no stop is attempted, and the virtual projects go away with
 *       the JVM. Nothing is written to disk, so the next EDT process starts with no comparison and
 *       nothing to clean up; there is no cross-process reclamation and this type does not pretend
 *       to one.</li>
 *   <li><b>"Free" is about the instant it was observed.</b> {@link Verdict#FREED} means EDT took
 *       the hand-back then. A comparison started from EDT's own interface a moment later takes the
 *       slot again under no id of ours, and this server can then only report that the slot is
 *       taken by something it cannot name.</li>
 *   <li><b>There is no partial hand-back, by construction.</b> Dropping the record is a removal
 *       from an in-memory map and cannot fail, so "the platform was told but the record could not
 *       be dropped" is unrepresentable. If the registry ever became durable that would stop being
 *       true, and the answer would be a different construction rather than one more verdict.</li>
 *   <li><b>The last-tick ownership window stays open.</b> A launch claims an outstanding
 *       cancellation once, at its single exit. A hand-over that lands after that claim is owed by
 *       nobody and is answered only by the job's own result - the handler's own sentence promises
 *       exactly that much and no more. Closing it needs the cancellation handler and the job to
 *       share one commit point, which is a change to the background-job registry and not to this
 *       feature.</li>
 * </ol>

     * Measured from {@code ComparisonManager} bytecode (EDT 2026.2,
     * {@code com._1c.g5.v8.dt.compare} 29.0.0), {@code stop(handle)} and {@code cancel(handle)}
     * compile to the same instructions apart from three things: the tracing call, the telemetry
     * string ("Comparison is finished without merging" against "Comparison is cancelled without
     * merging"), and a status stamp {@code cancel} writes onto the session it is discarding. Both
     * stop the running comparison job when the batch is under active comparison, both return early
     * under an active merge - which cannot happen here - and both discard the session.
     * <p>
     * That measurement is what lets the accounting be identical for the two, and it is also why
     * the old code's cancel-THEN-stop pair was redundant: the first call had already discarded the
     * session, so the second one found nothing and reported "already gone" as its ordinary answer.
     * ONE call is made now, and this enum only decides which name EDT records it under.
