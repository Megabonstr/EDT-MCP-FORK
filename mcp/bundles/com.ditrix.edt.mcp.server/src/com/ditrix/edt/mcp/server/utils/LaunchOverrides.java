/**
 * Per-launch attribute overrides for a debug launch: the {@code /C} startup option, and the
 * external data processor / report to run on startup ({@code /Execute}).
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing here is persisted.</b> The overrides are applied to an
 * {@link ILaunchConfigurationWorkingCopy}, which is itself an {@link ILaunchConfiguration} and can
 * be launched directly, so the saved EDT configuration is never modified. {@code doSave()} is
 * deliberately never called - the working copy is created, stamped and launched.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Why the external object is named, not pathed</h2>
 *
 * <p>EDT's {@code RuntimeClientLaunchDelegate} resolves the object inside an
 * {@code IExternalObjectProject}, has the platform BUILD its dump, and passes the dump as
 * {@code /Execute}. There is no launch attribute that accepts a prebuilt {@code .epf}, and adding
 * one outside EDT would not help: the debugger maps breakpoints through the external object's
 * PROJECT ({@code RuntimeDebugClientTarget.getExternalObjectProject}), so a file with no sources in
 * the workspace could be executed but never stepped through. Import such a file into an
 * external-objects project first.</p>
 *
 * <h2>The silent-success trap this class exists to close</h2>
 *
 * <p>When the object cannot be resolved, or the project's dump generation is switched off, the
 * delegate does NOT fail the launch - it writes to the EDT log and starts the session with no
 * {@code /Execute} at all. The caller would see a perfectly successful launch in which the
 * processor simply never ran. So everything the delegate will need is verified HERE, before the
 * launch, and a failure is a refusal with a reason.</p>
