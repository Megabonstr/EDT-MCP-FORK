/**
 * A READ-ONLY window onto one live comparison.
 *
 * <h2>Why it exists</h2>
 * EDT's {@code IComparisonSession} is a single interface that both reads the comparison tree and
 * REWRITES it — it can set merge rules, re-parent nodes, break correspondences and adopt external
 * properties. Handing that interface to a tool would make "this feature only reads" a promise kept
 * by review rather than by the type system. This view exposes the reading half and nothing else, so
 * a tool that never receives the session cannot mutate what it is describing. The ONE mutating
 * operation this half legitimately needs — priming a lazy subtree so that reading it tells the
 * truth — lives on {@link ComparisonEngine}, where it is visible in one place. Recording a merge
 * decision is NOT such an operation: decisions are written to EDT's merge-rules FILE by
 * {@code merge_rules}, never onto the live comparison, and {@link #availableMergeRules} is what
 * that file's rules are checked against before it is written.
 *
 * <h2>The transaction boundary (CLAUDE.md don't #1)</h2>
 * The nodes below are {@code IBmObject}s of the COMPARISON's own BM store, not of the workspace
 * project's. {@code BmTransactions.read(project, …)} therefore opens the WRONG store and is not a
 * valid boundary for any of these calls. Every method here must be invoked from inside
 * {@link ComparisonEngine#read(ComparisonView, String, com.ditrix.edt.mcp.server.utils.BmTransactions.BmOperation)}
 * (or its {@code IBmTask} sibling), which routes to
 * {@code IComparisonSession.runComparisonTreeReadonlyTask}. This class deliberately does NOT open a
 * boundary of its own: a helper that silently opened one per call would turn one consistent read of
 * a tree into a sequence of unrelated ones.
 *
 * <h2>Laziness</h2>
 * The tree is built on demand. A node whose {@link #topNodeStatus(long)} is
 * {@link ComparisonNodeStatus#UNFINISHED} or {@link ComparisonNodeStatus#HAS_UNFINISHED_CHILDREN}
 * has not been compared yet, and reading its children then yields an EMPTY list — which renders as
 * "no differences" and is a lie. Prime it with {@link ComparisonEngine#prioritize} and wait on the
 * NODE's own status before reading it.
 *
 * <h2>Labels</h2>
 * There is deliberately no label accessor. {@code ComparisonUtils.getLabel} delegates to a function
 * that branches on {@code Locale.getDefault()}, so its output depends on the machine the server
 * happens to run on — the same defect this repository already banned in
 * {@code MetadataReferenceService.getFeatureLabel}. Callers name nodes from the comparison
 * symlink/FQN instead, which is stable.
