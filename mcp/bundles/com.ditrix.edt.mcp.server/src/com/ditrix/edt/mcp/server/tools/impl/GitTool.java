/**
 * Runs a git command in a project's repository via the real {@code git} CLI - the non-UI equivalent of
 * typing it in a terminal. The agent sends a shell-style command STRING (e.g. {@code status},
 * {@code commit -m "fix"}, {@code push origin main}); the tool PARSES it, accepts only a safe
 * {@link #ALLOWED_SUBCOMMANDS whitelist} of subcommands, and executes {@code git} with a clean argument
 * vector - never through a shell, so there is no command-injection surface.
 * <p>
 * Authentication and configuration are the MACHINE's ({@code ssh-agent} / a git credential helper / the
 * user's {@code ~/.gitconfig}) - exactly like the terminal the developer already uses; the tool never
 * stores a secret and never prompts ({@code GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0} makes a missing credential fail fast
 * instead of hanging). It runs equally against an EGit-shared project and a plain {@code .git} checkout,
 * so it does not require EGit.
 * <p>
 * Powerful (it can run push / checkout / stash / ...), so it is placed in its own {@code git} toolset and
 * <b>disabled by default</b> - the operator opts in by checking it in the MCP Server Tools preference tab
 * (it is disabled at the TOOL level, so {@code enable_toolset}, which only affects progressive-disclosure
 * visibility, does not turn it on). Runs on a bounded ({@link #TIMEOUT_SECONDS}s) external process off the
 * UI thread; a timeout kills the process tree.
 * <p>
 * <b>Trust boundary.</b> This is a terminal-equivalent convenience, NOT a sandbox. What it guarantees
 * is the list above: no shell, a whitelisted subcommand, consent before a write, nothing that waits
 * for a human, one bounded process killed with every child the JVM can still see (a fully DETACHED
 * grandchild is out of reach - the JVM has no portable process-group/job-object API, which is why
 * descendants are sampled while git runs), a capped output. Everything else here - the
 * blocked-option list, the checks that keep a path inside the repository, the credential redaction -
 * is a best-effort guardrail against a common mistake. Git owns the option grammar (values attach,
 * cluster and abbreviate) and the output format, so those guardrails cannot be complete, and the
 * repository's own config (hooks, filters, credential helpers, {@code core.sshCommand}) runs with the
 * EDT user's authority exactly as it does in the developer's terminal. Extend them when a real
 * spelling is found - but do not present them as containment: the honest answer for an unattended,
 * hostile-input setting is a structured tool with fixed argument vectors, not a wider denylist.
 * <p>
 * GPG signing is neutralized in the executed COMMAND (the signing config is off and no usable
 * {@code gpg.*program} remains), not by inspecting tokens: git accepts too many spellings of a signing
 * flag for a scan to be reliable, and every attempt at one produced false rejections of legitimate
 * values. A signing request therefore fails fast with a git error instead of opening pinentry - and,
 * because git verifies with the same programs, signature VERIFICATION is unavailable here too (stated
 * in the tool guide).

     * ends the host portion at the first of {@code /}, {@code ?} and {@code #} too, so for
     * {@code https://user:s3cr3t?x@example.com/r.git} it sends no credential at all and takes
     * {@code user:s3cr3t} for the HOST. The reason is the REDACTION: its userinfo scan
     * ({@link #userinfoEnd}) bails at that same {@code ?} and so finds no {@code @} at all, leaving
     * {@link #redactCredentialUrls} to mask what it takes for a query and emit
     * {@code https://user:s3cr3t?***} - the whole secret verbatim. Judging a stored URL by the RFC
     * shape would not even SEE the {@code @} of that one, and would let it past the refusal.
     * <p>
     * Production judges stored text through {@link #carriesUnmaskableCredential}, which walks it by

    /**
     * Whether an authority holds a userinfo the redaction cannot be trusted to mask. THE rule -
     * there is no second one anywhere in this check.
     * <p>
     * Every authority is judged here, wherever it sits, and by the same boundary
     * ({@link #gitAuthorityEnd}). A URL standing in another URL's path used to get its own,
     * slightly different, parallel version of this logic, and four review rounds in a row found the
     * next place where the two spellings disagreed. What position may change is one FACT, passed in
     * as {@code redactionScans}: whether {@link #redactCredentialUrls} looks at this URL at all. It
     * changes no rule.
     * <p>
     * In order, and each step is the same for every caller:
     * <ol>
     * <li>NO userinfo - no {@code @} before the authority ends - and there is nothing to protect,
     * whoever reads it. An authority with whitespace but no {@code @} is an odd host, not a
     * secret, and refusing it would be an outage for no gain. The {@code @} taken is the LAST one,
     * git's own reading: an email-style user name means
     * {@code user@corp.com:secret@host} closes its userinfo at the second.</li>
     * <li>ASCII whitespace or a control character in the authority - refused wherever it sits and
     * whoever is reading. Every scan {@link #redactCredentialUrls} makes FOR a credential stops
     * there, so {@code https://user@ho st:s3cr3t@example.com/r.git} is masked only to the FIRST
     * {@code @} and hands {@code :s3cr3t@} out verbatim; and no legitimate authority carries
     * either character.</li>
     * <li>git's documented SSH LOGIN ({@link #isPlainSshLogin}) - {@code ssh://git@host/r.git}, a
     * user name with no password marker. Not a secret, so nothing to mask and nothing to refuse.
     * The input guard accepts exactly this spelling; refusing it here would judge one form by two
     * rules.</li>
     * <li>What is left IS a credential, and it survives only if the redaction really will mask it.
     * That needs BOTH: that the redaction scans this URL ({@code redactionScans}), and that its own
     * walk reaches the {@code @} ({@link #redactionFindsUserinfo}) - a {@code ?} or {@code #} in
     * front of it stops {@link #userinfoEnd}, which then reports "no userinfo" while the query
     * branch masks only what FOLLOWS, so {@code https://user:s3cr3t?x@example.com/r.git} comes out
     * as {@code https://user:s3cr3t?***}. When the {@code @} comes first nothing is hidden and
     * {@code https://user:s3cr3t@host?to=a@b} is not refused.</li>
     * </ol>
     * Step 4 is about the REDACTION's reach, not about who owns the secret, so it also refuses a
     * credential-free {@code https://example.com?to=a@b}, whose verbatim prefix is a mere host.
     * Telling that prefix from {@code user:s3cr3t} would mean guessing; and the input guard in
     * {@link #parseCommand} rejects every remote URL carrying a {@code ?} or {@code #} anyway.
     * <p>
     * So the whole matrix reduces to one row per position, differing only where the FACT differs:
     * <table border="1">
     * <caption>authority x position</caption>
     * <tr><th>authority</th><th>top level (scanned)</th><th>nested (not scanned)</th></tr>
     * <tr><td>whitespace in it</td><td>REFUSE</td><td>REFUSE</td></tr>
     * <tr><td>{@code ssh://git@host} login</td><td>allow</td><td>allow</td></tr>
     * <tr><td>bare {@code <token>@host}</td><td>allow - masked</td><td>REFUSE - nothing masks it</td></tr>
     * <tr><td>{@code user:pass@host}</td><td>allow - masked</td><td>REFUSE - nothing masks it</td></tr>
     * <tr><td>whitespace in it, then a {@code ?} / {@code #}</td><td colspan="2">REFUSE - the

     * whole is printed instead ({@link #unreachableDelimiter}). A query it CAN reach stays its

     * <p>
     * A {@code :} with no {@code @} behind it is not judged at all: an scp-like remote and a Windows
     * path are both full of them, and it is the {@code @} that turns what precedes it into a
     * userinfo. What this cannot catch is the same thing nothing can - a secret that is not marked as
     * one, a bare token standing in for a login.
     * <p>
     * That last limit is also why the marker is not worth hardening against evasion. This asks what
     * a stored value IS, for the operator who parked a credential in it by accident; whoever can
     * WRITE the configuration can store the same secret unmarked ({@code ghp_token@host}), which no

     * <li>READ: {@code remote.<name>.url} and {@code .pushurl} (both multi-valued), the subsection
     * NAME, the members of a remote GROUP ({@code [remotes] <group> = ...}), and git's legacy
     * {@code $GIT_COMMON_DIR/remotes/*} / {@code $GIT_COMMON_DIR/branches/*} files - measured: each
     * of those is printed verbatim by a command in {@link #REMOTE_SUBCOMMANDS}.</li>
     * <li>READ, and from the place git reads it rather than the place JGit does: inside a LINKED
     * worktree the configuration and both legacy directories live in the SHARED repository, which
     * JGit 6.8 cannot even name ({@link GitCommonDirectory}). Every source above is taken from
     * there, and the {@code <git dir>/config} JGit does read - which git ignores in a linked
     * worktree - is taken back out ({@link #inheritedChain}), so this check judges neither less nor
     * more than the command it is guarding.</li>
     * <li>NOT read: {@code remote.pushDefault} and {@code branch.<name>.remote} /
     * {@code .pushRemote}. They can hold a URL, but the only place git puts one is a transport
     * error, and there it strips the userinfo itself ({@code fatal: unable to access
     * 'https://example.com/r.git/'} - measured on git 2.35.1, the credential gone). Nothing to
     * leak, so nothing to refuse.</li>
     * <li>NOT read: {@code url.<base>.insteadOf} rewrites and conditional {@code [includeIf]}
     * sections, both below.</li>
     * </ul>
     * Two limits are deliberate and stated in the tool guide: a {@code url.<base>.insteadOf} or
     * {@code .pushInsteadOf} rewrite rule is NOT inspected - both rewrite the effective URL (the
     * second one for push only), and that URL is git's to compute - and of git's two include forms
     * JGit follows only the UNCONDITIONAL one: {@code Config} resolves an {@code [include] path}
     * entry through {@code FileBasedConfig.readIncludedConfig}, so remotes defined in such a file
     * ARE enumerated here, while a conditional {@code [includeIf "..."]} section is not evaluated at
     * all and a remote defined only there is invisible. Both remain covered by the best-effort
     * output redaction, not by this refusal.
     * <p>
     * Fails CLOSED: when the configuration cannot be read at all the command is refused with
     * {@link #CONFIG_UNREADABLE_REFUSAL}, and when a linked worktree's {@code commondir} pointer
     * cannot be resolved with {@link #commonDirRefusal}. Neither text embeds any file
     * content.
     * <p>
     * A limit worth stating, because it is not one this check can close: opening a linked worktree
     * as a JGit repository yields a BARE one (JGit derives the work tree from a configuration it
     * reads from the wrong place), and {@link #execute} needs a work tree before it gets here. So
     * on the versions this plug-in ships against, a linked worktree fails earlier with its own
     * error rather than reaching this check. The check is written for what git prints, not for what
     * the current opener happens to reach: the day a repository there opens with a work tree - a
     * newer JGit knows the common directory - the blindness would otherwise have shipped with it.

     * <p>

     * reference-counted instance - and {@code getConfig()} refreshes only what JGit's
     * {@code FileSnapshot} NOTICES: a changed size, file key, or mtime. An in-place edit that keeps

     * print today's credential. Reading from disk here costs a few small file reads on the four
     * remote-reaching subcommands and removes that heuristic from the answer altogether.
     * <p>
     * The whole base chain is walked, because a remote can be inherited (repository - user -
     * system). THREE limits are real, and none of them is papered over:
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@code ~/.gitconfig} is held by JGit in a {@code UserConfigFile}, whose {@code load()}
     * OVERRIDE re-reads only when {@code isOutdated()} says so - a forced reload of that one link is
     * not reachable through the public API, so there it stays JGit's own detection. The
     * repository's own {@code .git/config}, the XDG file behind {@code ~/.gitconfig} and the system
     * file are plain {@code FileBasedConfig}s and are re-read unconditionally.</li>
     * <li>An {@code [include]}d file is re-read only when the file that INCLUDES it changed:
     * {@code load()} hashes the bytes it just read and skips the parse when the hash is what it
     * parsed last time, and an include is followed from inside that parse. Editing only the
     * included file therefore stays invisible here, exactly as it is to {@code isOutdated()}, which
     * keeps no snapshot for it either.</li>
     * <li>Nothing here closes the gap between this read and git's own: the configuration can be
     * rewritten after the check and before the process starts. No check-then-run can close that, and
     * the guide says so instead of implying otherwise.</li>
     * </ul>
     * That same hash check is why re-reading the SHARED user and system objects is safe to do on
     * every call: when the bytes on disk are unchanged - the ordinary case - nothing is re-parsed
     * and no in-memory state is replaced, so an unsaved change another part of the IDE is holding
     * survives. When the bytes DID change, the state is replaced - but then JGit's own
     * {@code isOutdated()} would have replaced it on the next read anyway.

     * resolves there, measured). Dropping the link and adding the shared file back is therefore the
     * same file in the one case where the two are the same directory - a {@code commondir} whose
     * content strips to nothing resolves back to the git directory - and the right file in every
     * other case. Either way the layer that ends up in the chain is the one git reads. Leaving that link in the chain would not be harmless-because-empty
     * - "it is empty" is an observation, not an invariant, and the chain does not merge the way a
     * single file does: {@link Config#getSubsections} and {@link Config#getSections} UNION every
     * link, and {@link Config#getStringList} CONCATENATES the base's values with the layer's own
     * (read from JGit's sources, not assumed). So an entry in a file git never opens would be
     * enumerated and could not be shadowed by a clean value above it - a refusal on a healthy
     * repository, the expensive direction.
     * <p>
     * The link is dropped ONLY when it can be IDENTIFIED, and identified by the very expression
     * {@code FileRepository} built it from ({@code getFS().resolve(getDirectory(), "config")}), so
     * on the shapes this plug-in is given the two {@link File}s are the same path by construction.

     * {@code <git dir>/config}, the test simply fails, nothing is dropped, and the shared layer
     * added below becomes a duplicate - which a predicate that unions and concatenates VALUES
     * cannot be changed by.</li>

     * <p>
     * With {@code extensions.worktreeConfig = true} git reads {@code <git dir>/config.worktree}
     * after {@code config} ({@code git rev-parse --git-path config.worktree} resolves it, and for a
     * linked worktree that git dir is the {@code .git/worktrees/<name>} directory JGit already
     * hands back). JGit 6.8 knows nothing about the file: neither {@code config.worktree} nor
     * {@code worktreeConfig} occurs anywhere in its jar, and a live repository carrying the
     * extension opens fine while {@code getConfig().getSubsections("remote")} lists only what
     * {@code .git/config} declares. So {@code remote -v} would print a remote this check never saw.
     * <p>
     * Layered as a BASE-chained {@link FileBasedConfig}, which is how git reads it too: a remote
     * declared only there is enumerated. What happens to one declared in BOTH is not the scalar
     * override it looks like, and the difference matters here: {@link Config#getStringList} - which
     * is what a multi-valued {@code url} is read through - CONCATENATES the base's values with the
     * layer's own, so both are judged and a clean worktree value cannot hide an inherited poisoned
     * one. That is the direction this check wants; it is recorded because the opposite was assumed
     * once. Built fresh on every call, so it needs no place in {@link #reloadFromDisk} - a new
     * object has no cached content to go stale.
     * <p>
     * The switch is read from the SHARED file, never from the merged chain, and NOT gated on
     * {@code core.repositoryformatversion}. All three halves are what git was measured doing
     * (2.35.1), not what its documentation suggests:
     * <ul>
     * <li>the switch and the FILE it switches on live in different places in a linked worktree:
     * {@code extensions.worktreeConfig} in the SHARED config, {@code config.worktree} in the
     * worktree's own git directory. Measured - with the switch in the shared config and the remote
     * in the worktree's {@code config.worktree}, {@code remote -v} prints it from the linked
     * worktree and NOT from the main one. Reading the switch from {@code <git dir>/config} there
     * would find nothing and silently disable this whole layer;</li>
     * </ul>
     * and, unchanged from before:
     * <ul>
     * <li>with the switch only in a user's {@code ~/.gitconfig} - via {@code GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL} -
     * {@code git remote -v} prints NOTHING from {@code config.worktree}. So an inherited one must
     * turn nothing on here either, or a stale file git ignores would take a repository off the
     * air;</li>
     * <li>with the switch in {@code .git/config} and {@code repositoryformatversion = 0} - the
     * default every ordinary repository carries - git prints the remote from
     * {@code config.worktree} all the same. A version gate here would therefore not be a second
     * belt but a hole: exactly the entries git reads and we would not.</li>
     * </ul>
     * The asymmetry is deliberate. Widening what is INSPECTED can only add refusals, which is the
     * safe direction; narrowing the condition that switches the file on is what keeps a stale
     * entry elsewhere from refusing a healthy repository.
     * <p>
     * The order this produces is git's own: {@code config.worktree} over the shared {@code config}
     * over the user's over the system's. Nothing here writes to the repository - every layer is a

     * {@code git remote set-url <name> <url>} writes {@code url} only, so it would leave a poisoned
     * {@code pushurl} ({@link #REMOTE_URL_KEYS}) exactly where it is; and against a MULTI-valued
