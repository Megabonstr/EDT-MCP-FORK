/**
 * Turns one finished three-way comparison tree into the Markdown a caller reads.
 * <p>
 * Split in two on purpose, because the two halves run in different places:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link Collector#accept(TopComparisonNode)} touches the platform nodes and must run
 * INSIDE the comparison's own read task - the nodes are {@code IBmObject}s of the
 * comparison's private BM store, so they are not valid outside it. It copies each node into
 * a plain {@link Node} and keeps the counters;</li>
 * <li>{@link #render(Header, ScopeSnapshot, Collector)} is pure text assembly over those
 * copies plus a {@link ScopeSnapshot} - and that is a COPY of the handle's scope taken in the
 * same read, not the handle's own object. The scope is not safe to read afterwards: the engine
 * extends it in place while the run proceeds, so a table rendered from it later lists objects
 * the rows beside it were never collected under. See {@link ScopeSnapshot}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Three honesty rules are built into the rendering and are what its tests pin:
 * <ol>
 * <li><b>Requested scope is not the compared scope.</b> {@link ComparisonScope#getInputScope}
 * is what the caller asked for; {@link ComparisonScope#getScope} additionally contains
 * everything the engine pulled in by itself. The report shows the first as "Requested" and
 * the second's delta - {@link ComparisonScope#getExtendedScope} - separately, with the
 * engine's own reason for each addition. Rendering the extended scope as the requested one
 * would report objects the caller never named as objects the caller chose.</li>
 * <li><b>An unfinished node is not an equal node.</b> The tree is lazy: a node whose
 * {@link ComparisonNodeStatus} is not {@code FINISHED} has not been compared yet, so it is
 * rendered as {@link ComparisonNodeState#NOT_COMPARED} and never counted as, or described
 * with, an absence of differences.</li>
 * <li><b>An empty tree is not an equal tree.</b> A comparison that produced no top node at
 * all compared nothing, so no claim about the sides can be derived from it. That case is
 * reachable without any failure: whatever {@link ComparisonScopeBuilder} checks about the SHAPE
 * of a scope entry, nothing there knows which names EXIST, so a correctly spelled qualified
 * name that exists on none of the three sides is a legal scope that selects nothing - and a
 * tree that was never built answers the same way. The report says what it observed instead of
 * asserting agreement.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Never routes a label through {@code ComparisonUtils.getLabel()}: that delegates to a
 * function branching on {@code Locale.getDefault()}, which would make the wire text depend
 * on the machine EDT happens to run on.

     * <h2>Why a copy, and why it is taken where the tree is walked</h2>
     * {@code ComparisonProcessHandle.getFullScope()} hands back the very object the engine
     * extends. Read off {@code ComparisonScope} 29.0.0: {@code extendScope} puts the added name
     * into the {@code HashMap} that {@link ComparisonScope#getExtendedScope} returns and appends
     * the reason to the {@code List} already under that name - both in place, neither copied,
     * neither wrapped unmodifiable. So a report that asked the handle AFTER walking the tree
     * listed a scope the rows below it were never collected under and presented the two as one
     * picture; and iterating that map while the engine writes to it is not merely inconsistent,
     * it is a plain {@code HashMap} read during someone else's {@code put}.
     * <p>
     * The copy is therefore taken inside the SAME comparison read that copies the rows, and it is
     * the copy the report renders. Whatever that boundary is worth for the nodes it is worth for
     * this; and an immutable copy taken there cannot grow afterwards whatever the boundary is
     * worth.
     * <p>
     * {@link ComparisonScope#getInputScope} is the one half that would not have needed defending -
     * that list is built once in the constructor, wrapped {@code Collections.unmodifiableList},
     * and never touched by {@code extendScope}. It is copied anyway, because the point is that
     * the two halves of one reading cannot come from two instants: they arrive together or not
     * at all.
     *
     * <h2>The two halves stay apart</h2>
     * {@link #requested(ComparisonSide)} is what the caller asked for and
     * {@link #addedNames(ComparisonSide)} is what the engine pulled in by itself, copied from the
     * two accessors that answer exactly those questions. Neither is
     * {@link ComparisonScope#getScope}, which is the two merged: rendering that as the request
     * would report objects the caller never named as objects the caller chose.

     * object's own features from the comparison whenever that object's qualified name is not under

     * added or deleted - and it can land in the table as {@code identical} having been compared
     * without the features that were excluded. That word means "compared, and equal" everywhere
     * else in this report, and there is no way to tell the two apart from the row itself.
     * <p>
     * The clause says that and no more. The exclusion is applied per FEATURE and spares a
     * containment-many collection of {@code MdObject}s, so a row outside the scope is NOT a row
     * nothing was looked at under: what the caveat withdraws from {@code identical} there is the
     * claim that the excluded features were compared, not the whole of the row.
     * <p>
     * Emitted ONLY for a scoped comparison, because it is only true of one: a whole-configuration
     * run has the setting off and compares content everywhere, and printing the caveat there would
     * describe a limit that was not applied.
     * <p>
     * Which of the two it was is READ FROM THE HEADER, not recomputed from the scope object. The
     * scope object is extended by the engine as the run proceeds, so recomputing here answers a
     * question about the scope as it ended up rather than about the setting the launch chose - and

     * The report prints a bounded prefix - {@code limit} names in a table cell and the same
     * {@code limit} names as bullets - and it used to obtain that prefix by copying the whole map
     * into a {@code TreeMap} and taking the front of it. Twice per side, so six times for a
     * comparison. Every one of those copies was O(n log n) comparisons and O(n) live entries while
     * the comparison read is still held, and it carried the VALUES along: an addition's reasons
     * are one string per requested object that pulled it in, so a common dependency of a large
     * request is a single printed line whose value list is thousands long. {@code limit=1} paid
     * all of it to print one name.
     *
     * <h2>What this bounds, and what it cannot</h2>
     * Bounded: what is ORDERED and what is RETAINED - never more than {@code limit} keys, and no
     * values at all. NOT bounded: how many keys are LOOKED at, which is n and has to be. The k
     * smallest of a set is not knowable without seeing every element, so an implementation that
     * stopped early would answer with the first k in the platform's own {@code HashMap} order -
     * a different answer, unstable between two runs of the same comparison, which is exactly what
     * the ordering was introduced for.
     * <p>
     * The map's SIZE is deliberately not part of the answer. The caller reads it from the map,
     * which knows it in constant time, and reports it in the truncation notice - so bounding the
     * output never costs the report its count of what it left out.
     *
     * @param entries the additions of one side, keyed by qualified name
     * @param limit largest number of keys to return; {@code 0} or less returns nothing
     * @return the keys, ascending, at most {@code limit} of them
