     * refactorings do not write files; they hand save tasks to the derived-data pipeline and
     * return. The platform's own synchronous save (its {@code saveNow}) differs from the
     * asynchronous one by exactly this wait, on exactly these two segments, so this is the same
     * barrier EDT uses on itself - not an approximation of one.
     * <p>
     * <b>What DRAINED does and does not prove.</b> It proves the export work finished. It does NOT
     * prove the bytes are correct: the platform's export task processor catches {@code Throwable}
     * around each file, logs it, and lets the computation complete normally, so a write that failed
     * (file locked, disk full, permissions) still drains. Treat DRAINED as "nothing is queued any
     * more", never as "the file is known good".
     * <p>
     * <b>Why the work is wrapped in a {@link BoundedJob}.</b> The platform's own timeout argument is
     * not a bound: its wait spends the full timeout draining accumulated contexts and only then
     * starts a FRESH deadline for the segment wait, and one leg of the context drain calls
     * {@code Object.wait()} with no argument at all. Passing a timeout therefore buys an advisory,
     * not a limit, and unattended safety needs a real one.
     * <p>
     * <b>What the deadline does NOT do.</b> {@code waitComputation} takes no progress monitor, so
     * cancelling the job cannot stop the wait - the deadline frees the CALLER, and the platform
     * call may still be running afterwards. That is why at most ONE export wait per project is
     * outstanding at a time: while a previous one has not come back, this returns
     * {@link DiskExportState#PENDING} immediately instead of scheduling a second unstoppable Job.
     * A wedged pipeline therefore costs one Job per project, not one per request.
     * <p>
     * That claim is itself bounded: a wait that never comes back would otherwise shut its project
     * out for the rest of the session, so the claim also lapses on its own deadline. The honest
     * statement is "at most one outstanding export wait per project at a time", not "ever".
