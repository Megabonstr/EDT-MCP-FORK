/**
 * Reads and writes EDT's merge-settings file into / out of {@link MergeRulesDocument}.
 * <p>
 * <b>WHICH CONTAINER THE PLATFORM READS DEPENDS ON THE EDT VERSION, and only the zip is read by
 * both.</b> Measured from the bytecode of {@code ComparisonManager.deserializeMergeSettings}: in
 * {@code com._1c.g5.v8.dt.compare} 28.0.1 (EDT 2026.1.2) it opens with the assertion
 * {@code May read merge settings from a xml-file or zip-file} and then branches on the extension;
 * in 29.0.0 (EDT 2026.2.0) the xml branch is GONE - the method opens with
 * {@code Assert.isTrue("zip".equals(FileUtil.getExtension(path)), "Can read merge settings from a zip file")}
 * and the whole class carries no {@code .xml} literal any more. So a {@code .xml} rules file is
 * read by 2026.1 and refused outright by 2026.2, while a {@code .zip} is read by both. READING
 * here accepts either, because either is a file somebody's EDT wrote.
 * <p>
 * <b>Writing a zip needs the comparison's own id, and this codec never invents one.</b> The
 * platform picks the entry whose name (minus its extension) equals
 * {@code <mainProject>_<otherProject>_<ancestorProject>} and merely LOGS A WARNING when no entry
 * matches - a zip whose entry is named anything else is silently ignored by EDT, decisions and
 * all. {@link #writeZip} therefore takes that id as an ARGUMENT: it is knowable only from a live
 * comparison ({@code ComparisonEngine.mergeRulesEntryId}), so a caller that cannot supply it has
 * to write {@code .xml} or refuse - never guess. {@link #write} writes the bare xml document.
 * <p>
 * <b>Writing is canonical and total.</b> The serializer emits every element, attribute and text
 * value the document holds, in the order it holds them, with a fixed layout (UTF-8, LF, two-space
 * indent). Nothing is projected away, so a file written from a parsed file differs from it only
 * in LAYOUT whitespace - and for a file already in this layout, not at all.
 * <p>
 * <b>Layout whitespace and character data are different things, and the line between them is
 * drawn per element:</b> an element whose character data is entirely whitespace is laid out, so
 * that whitespace is regenerated; an element with any non-whitespace character data is mixed
 * content, and then all of its character data - the spaces beside a child element included - is
 * kept byte for byte and written back inline. See
 * {@code separateLayoutFromContent}, which also states the one case the rule cannot tell apart.
 * <p>
 * <b>A comment and a processing instruction are payload too.</b> Both are kept as nodes in
 * document order, beside the text and the child elements, and re-emitted verbatim - a comment is
 * where a human writes down WHY a decision was made, and a rewrite that dropped it would delete
 * exactly the part of the file this codec has no other way to carry. They are kept in the prolog
 * and the epilog as well, where XML puts them outside the root element.
 * <p>
 * Two differences are known and stated rather than implied, because both are invisible to any XML
 * reader: an element with empty content is re-emitted self-closing ({@code <A></A>} becomes
 * {@code <A/>} - the same empty content); and the whitespace between a processing instruction's
 * target and its data is re-emitted as ONE space, because a parser reports the data with that
 * separator already consumed and how many spaces the file spelled is not knowable from what was
 * read.
 * <p>
 * <b>A document that uses an XML namespace is REFUSED, not read.</b> Namespace prefixes are not
 * modelled, and for this format that is not a gap: EDT's own serializer never writes one - it
 * makes no {@code writeNamespace} / {@code setPrefix} call anywhere - and its reader keys on
 * local names, so a prefix can only come from a hand edit, a block pasted in from somewhere else,
 * or a future EDT. What such a file cannot be is CARRIED, and that is why it is refused instead
 * of being read with a stated difference: a namespace declaration is not an attribute, so it is
 * never seen and can never be written back; a prefixed element is read under its local name and
 * comes back stripped; and two attributes that differ only by their prefix share one local name,
 * so the second overwrites the first and a value is deleted outright. Refusing a payload is
 * honest, silently mangling one is not - and the lossless promise on {@link MergeRulesDocument}
 * holds BECAUSE of this refusal. Modelling prefixes is a different job of a different size, and
 * no legitimate file of this format needs it. See {@code rejectNamespaceUse}.
 * <p>
 * <b>A document in which two SIBLING {@code <Node>} elements carry the same {@code Key} is
 * REFUSED too</b>, and for the same reason the namespace case is: it cannot be carried honestly.
 * EDT matches nodes by string equality, so of two siblings under one key only the first is ever
 * found - a rule written to that address updates the first and leaves the second in the file with
 * a rule of its own, and the rewrite then hands back a document that says two different things
 * about one node. The tool already refuses two decisions addressing one node in its own request;
 * this is that same question asked of the file. See {@code rejectDuplicateNodeKeys}.
 * <p>
 * <b>A document that declares an XML version this codec does not write is REFUSED as well</b>, and
 * it is the third member of the same family: what cannot be carried honestly goes back rather than
 * being rewritten into something else. The declaration this class emits is fixed
 * ({@code version="1.0"}), so a source that declared {@code 1.1} would come back declared
 * {@code 1.0} - and that is not a layout difference, it is a different GRAMMAR handed to the next
 * reader. XML 1.1 admits characters 1.0 has no spelling for: measured on this JDK's StAX reader,
 * {@code &#x1;} in text or in an attribute value parses under a {@code 1.1} declaration and yields
 * U+0001, while the same reference under {@code 1.0} is refused outright as "an invalid XML
 * character". Re-emitting that character under a {@code 1.0} declaration therefore produces a file
 * that THIS codec's own {@link #read(Path)} refuses - the tool would report the rules as written
 * and then be unable to read them back, and so would EDT. See {@code rejectUnwritableXmlVersion}.

     * ATTEMPTS its group.</b> A move replaces the directory entry, so the file that ends up on the
     * path is the TEMPORARY's inode with the temporary's mode - and {@code Files.createTempFile}
     * creates one readable by its owner alone. Replacing a rules file a team shares would
     * therefore have narrowed it to whoever ran the write, silently, on every save. The mode of
     * whatever is on the path is read and applied to the temporary BEFORE the move, so where the
     * store accepts it the file lands wearing the target's mode instead of the temporary's; where
     * the store answers that it keeps no POSIX permissions, applying it is SKIPPED and the
     * temporary's own mode stands. The GROUP is a separate step whose every failure is swallowed -
     * see {@code inheritGroup} - so a file can land with its mode carried and its group not.
     * <b>There is no blanket promise here that the target's permissions survive</b>: one attribute
     * is carried where the store accepts it, the other is attempted, and what a file's permissions
     * are made of beyond those two - a Windows ACL, an access-control entry somebody set by hand -
     * is not carried at all.
     * <p>
     * A filesystem with no POSIX view - Windows - has no mode or group to carry and is left alone.
     * A path with nothing on it has no mode to inherit either, so such a file keeps the
     * temporary's own - which is the restrictive one, and the safe direction for a file this call
     * is creating. Under {@link Target#MUST_NOT_EXIST} there IS something on the path by then: the
     * reservation this method made with {@code Files.createFile}, so the finished file wears the
     * process default rather than the temporary's owner-only mode.
     * <p>
     * <b>DECLARED LIMITATION: the target's OWNER is NOT carried.</b> This method replaces the file
     * OBJECT, so what ends up on the path is the temporary, belonging to whichever account the
     * temporary was created for; where that differs from the account the target belonged to, the
     * owner CHANGES and nothing in the answer says so. Carrying it is not attempted and the write
     * is not refused over it either - see {@code inheritPermissions} for why both alternatives
     * were measured and rejected. Do not aim {@code filePath} at a file that belongs to another
     * account.
     * <p>
     * <b>The move itself always replaces</b>, and it has to: it moves the temporary onto the
     * target. What {@link Target#MUST_NOT_EXIST} adds is a RESERVATION taken before a single byte
     * is written - {@code Files.createFile}, the create-if-absent the filesystem performs as one
     * indivisible operation - and a check, taken as the last step before the move, that the path
     * still holds THAT file; a path holding anything else is refused rather than replaced. The
     * check NARROWS the window and does not close it - POSIX has no "rename only if the target is
     * still this file" - and {@code refuseUnlessThePathStillHoldsTheReservation} says exactly what
     * is left of it. A reservation that is not consumed is removed again - on
     * EVERY failure that can follow it, including the one that creates the scratch file - so a
     * failed write leaves the path as free as it found it. An empty file left there would be
     * worse than the failure it followed: the write reports an I/O error, and every later write
     * to that path then refuses it as occupied while it holds no rules at all.

     * The final move carries {@code REPLACE_EXISTING} and has to: under
     * {@link Target#MUST_NOT_EXIST} there IS a file on the path by then - the reservation. The
     * reasoning that made that safe ("the file the move replaces is this call's own reservation")
     * is true of the moment the reservation was taken and of no moment after it. Between the claim
     * and the installation the path is an ordinary name in a directory anybody may write to:
     * another process - another run of this very tool - can remove the empty reservation and put
     * its own rules file there. The move then DESTROYED that file and the write reported success,
     * which is the loss this {@code Target} exists to prevent, reached along the one path nobody
     * was watching: the recorded identity was consulted after an exception and never otherwise.
     *
     * <h2>The same judgement as the clean-up, not a second one</h2>
     * {@link #isTheSameFile} decides it, exactly as {@code releaseReservation} decides it: by
     * SHAPE first - an empty regular file created and last modified at the recorded instants -
     * with {@code fileKey()} allowed only to NARROW that answer, because a POSIX store hands a
     * freed inode straight back to the next create in the same directory and a matching key alone
     * therefore proves nothing. One question, one answer, in both directions.
     *
     * <h2>DECLARED LIMITATION: the window is narrowed, not closed</h2>
     * This reads the path and then renames onto it, and POSIX offers no "rename only if the target
     * is still this exact file": {@code rename(2)} replaces whatever the name resolves to at the
     * instant it runs, and neither {@code ATOMIC_MOVE} nor any other {@link StandardCopyOption}
     * adds a precondition to it. A replacement landing between this read and the rename is
     * therefore still destroyed, silently, exactly as before. What the check removes is the WIDE
     * window - the bytes, the temporary, the permission inheritance, everything a write does
     * between the claim and the installation; what it leaves is the gap between two adjacent
     * syscalls. That is a difference of degree, and it is written down rather than implied,
     * because a caller reading "the move replaces only this call's own reservation" would be
     * reading a guarantee this filesystem cannot give. The store that answers
     * {@code AtomicMoveNotSupportedException} gets a second gap of the same width, which is why
     * the fallback move asks this question again instead of carrying the first answer over.
     * <p>
     * The widest of those gaps is the branch where the reservation was found GONE: nothing is on
     * the path, so the move goes ahead with {@code REPLACE_EXISTING} and a file created there in
     * the meantime is replaced. Narrowing that one means moving without

     * own rules file there. Deleting by path then deletes SOMEBODY ELSE'S FILE, and the caller is
     * told only that a write failed.
     *
     * <h2>What the identity can and cannot tell apart</h2>
     * The SHAPE carries the answer on every platform: the reservation is an EMPTY REGULAR file
     * created and last modified at the instants recorded, and whatever is not one of those is a
     * different file. {@code fileKey()} - the {@code (device, inode)} pair a POSIX store answers,

     * that shape, never a replacement for it.
     * <p>
     * <b>Why the key alone was wrong, named rather than implied: INODE REUSE.</b> The key names
     * the FILE rather than the path, which reads as proof that a replacement must differ - and
     * that reading is false for the one sequence a replacement actually performs, DELETE followed
     * by CREATE. A filesystem is free to hand the just-freed inode straight back to the next
     * create in the same directory, and Linux ordinarily does, so the foreign file written onto
     * this path is answered THE SAME KEY the reservation was. Taking the key for the whole answer
     * therefore recognised somebody else's rules as this call's own litter and deleted them -
     * precisely the loss the identity exists against, and reachable only on the platforms that
     * answer a key at all. That is why the key may only ever narrow the shape's answer.
     * <p>
     * <b>The limit that remains.</b> The check cannot tell the reservation from a replacement that

     * the guide says so rather than promising the group is kept: setting one needs the account to
     * belong to it, so where the filesystem says no the file lands with the group it was created
     * with.
     *
     * <h2>DECLARED LIMITATION: the user OWNER is not carried, and no write is refused over it</h2>
     * The file that ends up on the path is the temporary, so it belongs to whichever account the
     * temporary was created for; where that differs from the target's owner, the owner CHANGES -
     * silently, exactly the way the mode used to. Both ways of doing better were tried and are
     * worse:
     * <ul>
     * <li><b>Preserving it is not GUARANTEED by anything public.</b> {@code Files.getOwner} and
     * {@code Files.setOwner} are public and do exist, so what is missing is the guarantee rather
     * than the API. The replacing move goes through {@code MoveFileEx} on the platform this plugin
     * runs on, which brings the TEMPORARY's whole security descriptor onto the path; applying an
     * owner afterwards needs a privilege an ordinary account does not hold, and the ACL view cannot
     * represent a full descriptor. That same descriptor swap is why the target's ACL does not
     * survive either, even where the owner happens to match.</li>
     * <li><b>So "preserve it or refuse the write" is a refusal in ORDINARY cases</b> - a target
     * left owned by {@code BUILTIN\Administrators} by one elevated run, or by a colleague's
     * account on a share - which trades a quiet defect for a rules file that cannot be saved at
     * all. That is the more expensive of the two, so it was withdrawn.</li>
     * <li><b>Writing into the existing file instead of replacing it is worse again.</b> The right
     * to replace a file through its directory is not the right to open THAT file for writing, and
     * a failure after the truncate leaves a partial file on the path where a concurrent reader can
     * see it - which is precisely what the temporary-then-move exists to prevent.</li>
     * </ul>
     * The limitation is therefore declared - here, in {@code write}, and in the tool's guide - and
     * the advice that follows from it is the caller's to act on: do not aim a write at a file that
     * belongs to another account.
     * <p>
     * Three things are deliberately NOT done here.
     * <ul>
     * <li><b>Nothing is invented for a path that is empty.</b> A target that does not exist has no
     * mode or group to inherit, and Java cannot read the process umask, so guessing one would be
     * this method asserting a permission set nobody chose. Such a file keeps the temporary's own,
     * which is the restrictive direction. Note that a {@link Target#MUST_NOT_EXIST} write does NOT
     * reach this case: its reservation is already on the path, created with the process default,
     * and that is what gets carried.</li>
     * <li><b>A filesystem without POSIX permissions is not a failure.</b> Windows has no mode or
     * group to carry, and the view is simply absent there; treating that as an error would make
     * every write on Windows fail over a concept that does not exist on it. This method is then a
     * no-op from end to end, which is the limitation above stated in code.</li>
     * <li><b>A group that cannot be set is a SKIP, not a write failure.</b> Changing a group is
     * refused whenever the account does not belong to the target's group - a file left behind by a
     * colleague, a shared directory the writer is not a member of - and the filesystem may not
     * support the operation at all. Refusing the whole write over it would turn a rules file that
     * saves perfectly well today into one that cannot be saved, over a permission the caller never
     * asked this tool to manage; the mode is still carried, and the file still lands. That is why
     * the group is attempted AFTER the mode, and why the two swallow DIFFERENT amounts: the
     * group's failures are swallowed wholesale, while applying the mode swallows only the store's
     * {@code UnsupportedOperationException} - an {@link IOException} from applying it still fails
     * the write, before the move, with the target untouched.</li>

     * @param replacement the temporary that will replace it
     * @throws IOException when the mode was read and applying it failed with an I/O error - which

     * containing that hop is reached through a symbolic link to somewhere else - or the
     * destination climbs out of it with {@code ..}. The everyday cases are unaffected: an absolute
     * destination never consults the parent, a relative destination inside a real directory
     * resolves identically either way, and a chain that fully exists never gets here.
     * <p>
     * <b>Why it is declared rather than patched.</b> An honest answer requires resolving EVERY
     * containing directory through the filesystem - the walk would have to canonicalise the parent

     * Looks in a zipped merge-rules archive for the entry ONE comparison would restore from, and
     * says what the archive holds instead when there is none.
     *
     * <h2>Why the question exists</h2>
     * A zip of merge settings is not one document but a BAG of them, one per comparison, and EDT
     * restores the single entry that belongs to the comparison being launched. Measured from
     * {@code ComparisonManager.deserializeMergeSettingsFromZipFile} - byte for byte the same
     * method in {@code com._1c.g5.v8.dt.compare} 28.0.1 (EDT 2026.1.2) and 29.0.0 (EDT 2026.2.0):
     * the archive is walked, each entry name is put through
     * {@code com._1c.g5.v8.dt.common.StringUtils.removeExtension} and compared with
     * {@code String.equals} against the comparison's own id, and an archive with NO matching entry
     * produces a logged warning and a {@code null}. The launch then proceeds with no decisions at
     * all - nothing is thrown, and the caller is told nothing. That is the case this lookup exists
     * to turn into an answer.
     *
     * <h2>The matching rule is the platform's, spelled out</h2>
     * {@code removeExtension} keeps the part after the last {@code /} or {@code \} and drops
     * everything from the last {@code .} of THAT part, so {@code saved/A_B_C.xml},
     * {@code A_B_C.zip} and a bare {@code A_B_C} all reduce to {@code A_B_C} - while
     * {@code A_B_C.old.xml} reduces to {@code A_B_C.old} and does not match. The comparison is
     * {@code equals}, so it is CASE-SENSITIVE.
     *
     * <h2>The walk stops at the match, and what it accumulates is bounded</h2>
     * A match SETTLES the question - the answer is a boolean, and no entry after the first match
     * can turn "there is one" into anything else - so the walk returns there and the rest of the
     * archive is never materialised. Nothing is dropped by stopping: the only thing the remaining
     * entries feed is the listing of what the archive holds INSTEAD, which exists for the refusal
     * and which a found lookup therefore has no use for (see {@link ZipEntryLookup}). A duplicate
     * of the entry is not a fact this answer carries either - a lookup asks whether the
     * comparison will find something, and two spellings that both reduce to the id are still
     * something.
     * <p>
     * With no match there is nothing to settle, so the walk runs to the end. It has to: the
     * platform walks every entry, so stopping early would answer "absent" for an archive EDT
     * reads fine, and the refusal's "it holds X instead" is only true of the whole archive.
     * <p>
     * <b>Why there is no {@link #MAX_ZIP_ENTRIES} bound here.</b> That bound refuses what
     * {@link #readZip} RETAINS - a name per entry, kept for every one of them - and this walk
     * retains at most {@link #MAX_LISTED_ZIP_ENTRIES} names however long it runs, so the cost it
     * exists to refuse is already absent. What is left is the per-entry {@code ZipEntry} the
     * enumeration hands out, which is garbage on the next iteration, and a bound could only be
     * charged AFTER {@code ZipFile} has read and validated the whole central directory on open -
     * so it would bound nothing that has not already been paid for. Refusing past a bound would
     * cost something real, though: an archive whose matching entry sits past it would be refused
     * while the platform restores from it, and a false refusal is worse than the silence this
     * lookup exists to remove.

     * Measured from {@code ComparisonManager.deserializeMergeSettingsFromZipFile}
     * ({@code com._1c.g5.v8.dt.compare} 29.0.0, EDT 2026.2.0): it opens {@code new ZipFile(path)},

     * needed, and an archive with no match produces a logged warning and a {@code null}. So an
     * archive holding just that entry, under the entry's own name, answers the platform's lookup
     * exactly as the original did - and the walk here stops at the first match too, which is the
     * same entry the platform would have taken.
     *
     * <h2>What this bounds, and what it does not</h2>
     * The whole-archive copy this replaces was unbounded: a valid archive holding the expected
     * small entry beside a multi-gigabyte unrelated one was duplicated byte for byte before
     * anything was looked up, and neither {@link #MAX_DOCUMENT_BYTES} nor {@link #MAX_ZIP_ENTRIES}
     * covered a raw copy. Now nothing but the addressed entry is read at all, and the entry itself

     * codec puts on a merge-settings document read from anywhere else. There is still no
     * {@link #MAX_ZIP_ENTRIES} bound on the WALK, for the reason {@link #lookUpEntry} states.
     *
     * <h2>The two failures are told apart, and the asymmetry is the point</h2>

     *
     * <h2>Why it is a refusal and not a merge</h2>
     * The node tree is a map addressed by key, and such a document says two things about one
     * address. Reading it means picking one, and the pick is invisible: EDT resolves a node by
     * string equality and stops at the first match, so the first sibling is the one every reader
     * sees, while the second sits in the file with a rule of its own that nothing will ever apply
     * and nothing will ever report. A rewrite would carry both forward, which is the one thing
     * this codec promises NOT to do quietly - and dropping one instead would delete a decision
     * somebody wrote. Neither is ours to choose, so the file goes back to the person who edited
     * it, in the same shape as every other grammar refusal here.
     *
     * <h2>The scan does not follow the addressing, it IS the addressing</h2>
     * Twice already this scan judged a shape no request can reach, and both times because it
     * answered a question {@link MergeRulesDocument} answers too - and answered it differently.
     * It judged every {@code MergeSettings} element while the document reads the first one; then
     * it treated every keyed {@code Node} in the container as a way in, while the document enters
     * at {@link MergeRulesDocument#ROOT_KEY} and nowhere else. A third wording would have been a
     * third instance, so the wording is gone: the container, the entry and the pick are asked of
     * {@code MergeRulesDocument} itself - {@code findContainer}, {@code findRoot},
     * {@code nodeChildren} and {@code findNode} - and this scan cannot address anything the
     * document cannot, because it does not know how to.
     * <p>
     * What it adds is the ONE question addressing cannot ask: a lookup picks the FIRST candidate
     * and can never see that there was a second, so the scan looks for that second candidate at
     * every element a lookup can stand on. Two consequences follow from the entry rule and are
     * worth naming, because each of them used to go the other way:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>a second {@code <Node Key="$$Root$$">} in the container IS refused - a rule written to
     *       the root updates the first one and everything under the second is addressed by
     *       nothing;</li>
     *   <li>a {@code <Node>} that sits BESIDE the root under any other key is not an entry at all,
     *       so neither it nor anything below it is judged. Refusing there named a pair no request
     *       can reach, at a level and under a path that do not exist.</li>
     * </ul>
     * A payload section this plugin does not interpret is likewise not walked: {@code nodeChildren}
     * answers the children of ONE element, so an element named {@code Node} inside a
     * {@code Properties} block is somebody else's content and is never reached.
     *
     * <h2>What it deliberately does NOT refuse</h2>
     * Two sibling {@code <Node>} elements that BOTH lack a {@code Key}. They are not two spellings
     * of one address - they have no address, so no rule can ever be written to them and no lookup
     * can confuse one for the other. That is a different question, it is pre-existing, and
     * answering it here would refuse files over a shape this refusal is not about.

     * Refuses a source whose XML declaration names a version this codec cannot hand back.
     *
     * <h2>Why the DECLARATION is what is judged, and not the characters</h2>
     * The serializer prints one fixed declaration, {@link #XML_DECLARATION}, so every rewrite comes
     * back as XML 1.0 whatever the source said. That is not a layout difference of the kind this
     * class's javadoc allows: the version decides which characters the document may hold at all,
     * so re-declaring it hands the next reader a grammar the file was never checked against.
     * <p>
     * <b>The route by which that goes wrong has exactly one entrance, and this is it.</b> Measured
     * on this JDK's StAX reader, with the same factory settings {@link #newSecureFactory()} uses:
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@code &#x1;} in character data or in an attribute value parses under a {@code 1.1}
     * declaration and arrives in the model as U+0001, and the same reference under a {@code 1.0}
     * declaration is refused - {@code Character reference "&#x1" is an invalid XML character} on
     * one reader, {@code Illegal character entity: expansion character (code 0x1} on another; the
     * refusal is the platform's, and so is its wording;</li>
     * <li>a LITERAL U+0001 is refused under BOTH versions, in content and in a comment alike, so a
     * restricted character can only ever enter through a character reference;</li>
     * <li>a declaration of {@code 1.2} never reaches this method - the reader refuses it itself
     * with {@code XML version "1.2" is not supported}.</li>
     * </ul>
     * So refusing the declaration closes the whole family at its single entrance, and no scan of
     * the parsed characters is needed to do it: nothing 1.0 cannot spell can be in a document that
     * declared 1.0, and nothing else is read.
     * <p>
     * <b>A 1.1 source with only ordinary characters is refused too</b>, and that is deliberate
     * rather than collateral. Two reasons, either of which is enough. The rewrite would silently
     * REPLACE the declaration, which is content of the file this codec promises to give back
     * unchanged. And XML 1.1 normalises U+0085 and U+2028 to a line feed where 1.0 does not, so a
     * 1.1 source's line ends come back differently and a rewrite would bake that in under a
     * declaration that never asked for it. Judging the repertoire instead would wave both through
     * while looking stricter.
     * <p>
     * <b>What is NOT refused:</b> a document with no declaration at all. The reader then applies
     * 1.0's rules - {@code getVersion()} answers {@code null} - so the parsed document is one this
     * codec can write, and adding the declaration on the way out is the canonical layout this class
