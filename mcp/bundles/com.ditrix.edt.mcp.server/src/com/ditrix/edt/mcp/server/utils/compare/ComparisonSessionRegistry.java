/**
 * Owns the lifetime of every live comparison this server started, keyed by a {@code comparisonId}
 * the caller can quote back on a later request.
 *
 * <h2>Why a registry rather than the job record</h2>
 * A comparison is not a computation that ends: while it is registered EDT keeps a VIRTUAL PROJECT
 * and a private BM store alive, and only ending the comparison gives them back. The obvious place
 * to park the handle — the background job's result — cannot own that lifetime:
 * {@code BackgroundJobs} evicts the oldest completed record when the map fills up, and that
 * eviction is a bare map removal with NO dispose hook. The handle would vanish with the record and
 * the resources behind it would stay allocated until EDT is restarted. So the registry, and only
 * the registry, owns the session; a job record may quote the id but never the handle.
 *
 * <h2>Liveness is asked of EDT, not remembered</h2>
 * {@link #find(String)} does not merely look the id up: it re-asks EDT for the handles it currently
 * holds for that project ({@code IComparisonManager.getHandles}) and reports the session as GONE
 * when EDT no longer lists it. A comparison can end without going through us — EDT restarts a
 * session, a user cancels one in the UI — and a registry that trusted its own map would then hand
 * out a handle whose store is closed. {@link #activeComparisonId()} and {@link #ids()} ask the same
 * question: the ids a refusal offers the caller are the ids EDT still holds, not the ids we once
 * issued.
 *
 * <h2>"Not yet visible" is not "already gone"</h2>
 * EDT's {@code startComparison} SCHEDULES the launch, so it can return before the handle turns up
 * in {@code getHandles}. A lookup that lands in that window sees an absence that means "not yet",
 * and reading it as "gone" took the session's ownership away: the tool reported the comparison
 * cancelled while the platform went on to start it, unowned and holding EDT's single slot. So
 * absence is only believed AFTER presence: each session carries a latch
 * ({@link ComparisonSession#seenAliveByEdt}) that is raised the first time EDT lists its handle,
 * and until it is raised an absence changes nothing.
 * <p>
 * The honest boundary of that rule, stated rather than left to be discovered: a session EDT NEVER
 * lists is not reclaimed by the liveness check at all. It is reclaimed by the idle sweep below,
 * which is bounded by the TTL rather than by the next lookup. The alternative - a short grace
 * measured from registration - was rejected because it also shields a session that WAS seen and
 * then died inside the window, which is the one absence that is real.
 *
 * <h2>ONE owner of the decision to give the slot back</h2>
 * {@link #handBack(String, SlotHandback.Ending)} is the only code in this bundle that ends a
 * comparison, and {@link SlotHandback} is what it answers with. Every other path here — the idle
 * {@link #sweep()}, {@link #releaseAll()} on the way out of the bundle — goes through the same
 * private step, so all three obey one invariant:
 * <p>
 * <b>The record is dropped exactly when the slot is CONFIRMED free.</b>
 * <p>
 * Two further methods drop a record without ending anything, and both are ROLLBACKS of a launch
 * that failed rather than ways to end a comparison:
 * {@link #withdrawUnstartedLaunch(String)}, reachable only when the platform was demonstrably
 * never asked to start anything, and
 * {@link #handBackRefusedLaunch(String, SlotHandback.Ending)}, which goes through the hand-back
 * above and drops the record only on the reading where EDT itself answers that it is not running
 * the comparison. Neither weakens the invariant: both leave the named comparison holding nothing,
 * which is what {@link SlotHandback#slotIsFree()} reports for them.
 * <p>
 * A session that could not be given back therefore STAYS registered, whether the hand-back failed
 * or could not be attempted at all. That is the honest state - it may still hold the slot - and it
 * has three effects that are all wanted: a refusal can still name it, {@code releaseComparisonId}
 * can still address it, and the next sweep retries the hand-back, which is what makes a session
 * stranded by a momentary service gap reclaim itself once the service is back. The reasoning
 * behind the invariant, and everything it does NOT promise, is written down once on
 * {@link SlotHandback}.
 * <p>
 * A session EDT has accepted but NOT BEGUN is not ended either, and it is not dropped: the
 * hand-back is WITHHELD, because both of EDT's ending verbs delete the Eclipse job the launch only
 * scheduled, and the method that gives EDT's own slot back runs inside that job. That is
 * {@link SlotHandback.Verdict#NOT_STARTED_YET}, and the reasoning is written down once on the
 * verdict. {@link #handBack(String, SlotHandback.Ending)} - the path with a caller waiting on it -
 * gives the platform a bounded moment to begin before it decides, so an ordinary cancellation of a
 * fresh launch still cancels.
 * <p>
 * {@link #releaseAll()} gives it that moment too, and then departs from the rule above in the one
 * way the rule cannot cover: it is the LAST call, so "kept, and retried by the next one" is not
 * true of it. It drops the record like every other session and writes what it could not give back
 * to the plug-in log instead, naming the comparison and its project. It still does not force an
 * unbegun launch to end - that costs EDT its comparison support for the rest of ITS life, which
 * outlives this server. The reasoning is on {@link #releaseAll()}.
 * <p>
 * A session that EDT has already forgotten is dropped WITHOUT being ended: asking the platform to
 * end a handle it no longer knows is not a no-op everywhere, and there is nothing left to give
 * back. That is the {@link SlotHandback.Verdict#ALREADY_FREE} answer: this comparison holds
 * nothing, which is what lets the record go - not a reading that EDT's slot stands empty.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing has to remember to sweep</h2>
 * The TTL sweep is not a separate chore a caller may forget: {@link #find(String)},
 * {@link #activeComparisonId()} and {@link #ids()} run it FIRST, so every comparison-tool call
 * reclaims what expired before it reads anything. That ordering is load-bearing in the refusal
 * path - EDT runs one comparison per instance, so an abandoned session would otherwise block every
 * later launch for as long as EDT runs, and the refusal would name a comparison nobody is using.
 * <p>
 * The honest boundary: reclamation is driven by the next question, and there is no timer. A
 * workbench where nobody touches a comparison tool again keeps its last session until
 * {@link #releaseAll()} runs on the way out of the bundle - bounded by this server's lifetime, not
 * reclaimed earlier. That is said here rather than left to be assumed, because a reader who
 * expects a sweeper thread would be expecting something that does not exist.
 *
 * <h2>A read in flight is not idle</h2>
 * The sweep measures idleness from the last LOOKUP, and a lookup is a moment while reading a
 * comparison tree is not: walking a large configuration can outlast the TTL between one
 * {@code find} and the next, and the sweep would then end the comparison underneath the BM read
 * that is running on it. {@link #lease(String)} is how a reader says "this one is in use": while
 * a lease is open the sweep passes the session over, and closing the lease touches it, so the TTL
 * restarts from the end of the read rather than from its beginning.
 *
 * <h2>Every budget here is ELAPSED time, not a moment on the wall clock</h2>
 * Three deadlines live in this class - the five minutes a preparing launch may hold the slot, the
 * thirty minutes a session may sit untouched, the ten seconds a hand-back gives EDT to begin - and
 * every one of them is a statement about how much time has PASSED. None of them is rendered, none
 * of them is compared against a reading from anywhere else, and none of them survives the wall
 * clock being corrected: a correction BACKWARDS keeps a dead launch worker's claim inside its
 * budget and refuses every later comparison on its account, while a jump FORWARD past the TTL makes
 * the next sweep reclaim a comparison a caller had just touched. So every reading here comes from
 * {@link ElapsedTime}, which accumulates forward progress and can neither step back nor jump, and
 * the readings kept in this class mean nothing outside it.
 * <p>
 * Every method that touches the map does so under this object's monitor: the sweep runs from
 * whichever call happens to touch the registry next, so it races with ordinary lookups by
 * construction. The ONE deliberate exception is the wait inside
 * {@link #handBack(String, SlotHandback.Ending)}, which takes and releases the monitor per reading
 * rather than holding it - a hand-back that held it for the length of its wait would stall the poll
 * of the very launch it is waiting for.

     * <h2>Why this exists, and why it is taken first</h2>
     * A launch used to ask {@link #activeComparisonId()} and then register its session at the far
     * end of its preparation - two git revisions resolved, the project looked up, the batch built.
     * The whole of that ran between the question and the answer being acted on, so two launches
     * arriving together both read "nothing is running", both prepared, and both registered. EDT
     * refused the second batch, but its registration stood, and this registry's own refusals are
     * computed from registrations: the slot was recorded as taken by a comparison that had never
     * started, and every later launch was refused until the idle TTL expired.
     * <p>
     * Claiming stakes the INTENT under this object's monitor, before any of that work. Of two
     * launches exactly one is granted, and the loser is refused with a sentence rather than
     * discovering the conflict from the platform a minute of git later.
     *
     * <h2>What a claim costs, and what it does not</h2>
     * A claim is given up either way - {@link #adoptClaim} turns it into the session, in the same
     * step as the registration, and {@link #withdrawClaim} drops it when the preparation failed.
     * Withdrawing touches ONLY the claim: it cannot drop the record of a comparison the platform
     * may be running, because it does not look at the session map at all. The rule that a record
     * survives whenever this server does not know what became of the comparison lives in
     * {@link #handBack(String, SlotHandback.Ending)} and is untouched here.
     * <p>
     * A claim that neither happens to is reclaimed after {@link #CLAIM_BUDGET_MILLIS} - the
     * backstop for a launch thread that died between the two.
     *
     * @param projectName the project the launch is being prepared for, for the refusal a second

     *       reach into a statement about the comparison, the fold this whole class exists to
     *       undo.</li>
     * </ul>
     * <b>The honest boundary.</b> "Begun" is read from EDT reporting a status for the handle, and
     * EDT stamps the first one inside the job's own run. A job that has started but not reached
     * that stamp - it is still opening the workspace operation - therefore reads as NOT begun, and
     * a hand-back is withheld although it would have been safe. That direction is the harmless one:
     * it costs a repeat, while the other direction costs EDT's comparison support until EDT is
