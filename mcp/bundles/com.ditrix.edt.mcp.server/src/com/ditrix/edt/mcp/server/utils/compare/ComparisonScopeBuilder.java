/**
 * Turns the caller's list of metadata full names into the {@link ComparisonScope} the comparison
 * engine understands - or into an actionable refusal.
 * <p>
 * Two facts shape everything here, and both were measured rather than assumed.
 * <p>
 * <b>1. The engine is monolingual.</b> A scope entry is a symlink: an EDT qualified name whose
 * STRUCTURAL segments are the English literals ({@code Catalog}, {@code Form}, {@code Subsystem},
 * {@code Configuration}). Nothing in the comparison engine translates them, so a Russian address
 * arrives as a symlink that matches no object - and matching nothing is not an error there, it is a
 * perfectly legal scope. Every entry is therefore canonicalized through
 * {@link MetadataTypeUtils#toCanonicalEnglishFqn(String)}, which translates EVERY structural segment
 * and leaves the programmatic Names - Cyrillic, mixed case and all - byte-identical.
 * <p>
 * <b>2. An empty scope is not a guard, it is "compare everything".</b>
 * {@code ComparisonSession.computeIsGlobalScope()} is true exactly when every side's list is
 * null-or-empty, so handing the engine an empty {@link ComparisonScope} silently escalates to a
 * full-configuration comparison - the heaviest thing this plug-in can start, on an EDT that allows
 * one comparison at a time. That escalation must be a decision, never an accident, so this builder
 * NEVER constructs a {@link ComparisonScope} from an empty list:
 * <ul>
 * <li>a scope that was not supplied at all ({@code null} or an empty list) yields
 * {@link Scoping#isGlobal()} with a {@code null} {@link Scoping#scope()} - the caller passes no scope
 * to the engine and reports the whole configuration as the comparison's subject;</li>
 * <li>a scope that WAS supplied but carries an unusable entry is REFUSED. Reading a typo as "then
 * compare everything" would answer a narrow question with the most expensive possible run.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * What it does NOT decide: whether a nested structural token exists. Only the LEADING token is
 * checked, against a catalogue that is complete for top-level types; the nested-kind catalogue is a
 * known subset of EDT's kinds, so refusing on it would turn a legitimate address into a false
 * refusal - the more expensive mistake of the two. An unrecognized nested token is copied verbatim
 * and stays visible in {@link Scoping#symlinks()}, which is what the report shows as the REQUESTED
 * scope.
