/**
 * In-memory model of EDT's merge-settings ("merge rules") file - the document a comparison
 * saves its per-node merge decisions into, and the one
 * {@code IComparisonManager.deserializeMergeSettings(handle, fileName)} reads back when a
 * comparison is launched.
 * <p>
 * <b>The shape is measured from the platform, not guessed</b> (bytecode of
 * {@code HierarchicalMergeSettingsSerializerService} and
 * {@code internal.compare.settings.model.MergeSettingsTree} on 2026.1.2):
 *
 * <pre>
 * &lt;Settings Format_version="2.0"&gt;
 *   &lt;Correspondences&gt;...&lt;/Correspondences&gt;      &lt;!-- optional, before OR after --&gt;
 *   &lt;MergeSettings&gt;
 *     &lt;Node Key="$$Root$$"&gt;
 *       &lt;Node Key="commonModules" MergeRule="GetFromOther"&gt;
 *         &lt;Node Key="main:other:ancestor" MergeRule="DoNotMerge"/&gt;
 *       &lt;/Node&gt;
 *     &lt;/Node&gt;
 *   &lt;/MergeSettings&gt;
 * &lt;/Settings&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * Three addressing levels are what the platform's own path generators produce:
 * <ol>
 * <li>the root marker {@link #ROOT_KEY};</li>
 * <li>a feature-collection node keyed by the EMF feature NAME
 * ({@code EStructuralFeature.getName()}, e.g. {@code commonModules});</li>
 * <li>a top-object node keyed {@code main:other:ancestor} - three NAMES joined by a colon
 * ({@code TopNodePathGenerator} formats {@code "%s:%s:%s"} out of {@code getMainSymlink()} /
 * {@code getOtherSymlink()} / {@code getCommonAncestorSymlink()}), with the literal
 * {@link #SIDE_ABSENT} standing for "this side has no such object". A rename therefore
 * legitimately yields three DIFFERENT names, and a one-sided add yields {@code X:NONE:X}.</li>
 * </ol>
 * Below the top object the key stops being a name: a {@code CollectionElementComparisonNode}
 * is keyed by the engine-computed {@code getPositionAfterMerge()}, i.e. a bare integer that
 * SHIFTS as soon as another rule changes. Such keys are read and reported, never authored -
 * see {@link #MAX_AUTHORABLE_DEPTH}.
 * <p>
 * <b>The file is sparse:</b> only decisions are written, so every {@code MergeRule} attribute
 * in it is a decision. (The live-session distinction {@code isMergeRuleSetByUser()} /
 * {@code isDefaultMergeRule()} is what keeps EDT's own defaults OUT of the file in the first
 * place; a parsed file no longer carries that difference.)
 * <p>
 * <b>Round-trip is lossless by construction.</b> The model is a generic XML element tree, not
 * a projection onto the handful of things this plugin understands: {@code Properties} maps,
 * nested sections and any attribute or element added by a future EDT are held verbatim and
 * re-emitted unchanged. Rules are held as the STRING literal found in the file, so an unknown
 * future rule survives a rewrite too - only a rule this plugin is asked to AUTHOR is parsed
 * and validated, and that happens in the tool, which is also the only place that may name the
 * platform's rule enum.
 * <p>
 * <b>"By construction" means the one input this model could not hold is never admitted into
 * it:</b> a document that uses an XML namespace. A prefix has no place here - an element is held
 * under its LOCAL name and its attributes are keyed by local names - so a declaration could not
 * be written back at all, a prefixed element would come back stripped, and two attributes
 * differing only by their prefix would collapse onto one key, the second deleting the first.
 * Rather than admit such a file and quietly rewrite the very payload this promise is about,
 * {@link MergeRulesCodec} REFUSES it at the parse; the refusal there also records why this format
 * never legitimately carries one.
