/**
 * Renders ONE expanded comparison-tree node to Markdown: the three-way property table, the per-side
 * form structure, the module section list, the vendor-support state, the child outline and the
 * POTENTIAL problems the engine reported for the subtree.
 *
 * <p>Three properties of this renderer are load-bearing and are each pinned by a test.</p>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li><b>A SCOPED run says so, and says it about the run.</b> A scoped comparison turns on
 * {@code mergeObjectsContent}, and {@code MdCompareUtils.isExcludeObjectsContentFeature} then
 * drops the own features of every object whose qualified name is not at or under an entry of the
 * effective scope - per feature, sparing the containment-many collections of {@code MdObject}s.
 * Such a node is matched, it was compared without the features that were dropped, and its flags
 * read exactly like those of a node that WAS compared on all of them and found equal. So
 * {@link Request#coverage} carries the fact into the document: it opens with
 * {@link #SCOPED_RUN_NOTICE}, the engine-filled tables qualify their emptiness with
 * {@link #CONTENT_MAY_BE_EXCLUDED} instead of saying {@link #NO_DIFFERENCES}, and an
 * {@code identical} {@code State} cell is qualified. What it deliberately does NOT do is decide
 * which side of the scope line THIS node fell on - see {@link ContentCoverage} for why no reading
 * of the tree answers that. The property table is not covered either: it is this class's own read
 * of the matched objects, so it still answers, and the notice says so.</li>
 * <li><b>No phrase of equality contradicts a number in the same document.</b> The {@code State}
 * cell comes from the platform's flags and the property table from this class's own reading, and
 * they can disagree: a node whose flags say {@code identical} while the table beside it counts a
 * differing property was measured live. The cell is then qualified with
 * {@link #STATE_DISPUTED_BY_PROPERTIES} and both facts are stated, because the two answer
 * different questions and picking one would delete an observation.</li>
 * <li><b>An unfinished subtree is reported as unfinished.</b> The comparison tree is LAZY
 * ({@code Unfinished} / {@code HasUnfinishedChildren} / {@code Finished}), so a node whose status is
 * not {@code Finished} has an empty or partial child list for a reason that has nothing to do with
 * the objects being equal. Every place that would otherwise say {@link #NO_DIFFERENCES} says
 * {@link #NOT_DETERMINED} instead while the node is unfinished, every {@code State} cell reads
 * {@link ComparisonNodeState#NOT_COMPARED}, and the document opens with
 * {@link #NOT_FINISHED_NOTICE}. Rendering "no differences" over an uncompared subtree is the exact
 * lie this design exists to prevent.</li>
 * <li><b>The state of a node is decoded ONCE, for both views.</b> Every {@code State} cell here is
 * {@link ComparisonNodeState#label()}, the same text {@link ComparisonTreeReport} puts in its
 * {@code Change} column for the same node. This class decided it separately until that separation
 * made the two documents contradict each other on a node both sides had changed the same way; see
 * {@link ComparisonNodeState} for what the two answers were.</li>
 * <li><b>Every label this class COMPUTES is locale-free.</b> Names come from the raw symlink
 * segment and from {@link StringUtils#nameToText}. The platform's own node labeller is deliberately
 * NOT used: it routes through a label function that branches on {@code Locale.getDefault()}, which
 * would make the English-only tool surface render Russian on a Russian EDT - the same defect already
 * fixed in {@code MetadataReferenceService.getFeatureLabel}. The claim covers what this class
 * WRITES, and there is exactly one thing it does not write: a
 * {@link PotentialMergeProblemDescription} is a bare pair of strings that the PLATFORM builds from
 * its own NLS bundles after a {@code Locale.getDefault()} lookup (read off
 * {@code MdObjectComparisonParticipant} on 2026.2.0+289, which uses the same lookup to pick Russian
 * type names), and the value holder carries no code or kind that could be rendered in their place.
 * Those two columns are therefore reproduced verbatim, their language follows the workbench, and the
 * table SAYS so in {@link #PLATFORM_TEXT_NOTICE} instead of letting the reader assume otherwise. The
 * locale-free identity of such a row is its {@code Node id} column.</li>
 * <li><b>Reads happen inside the caller's boundary.</b> Every accessor here touches comparison-tree
 * nodes, which live in the comparison's OWN BM store; the caller must already be inside
 * {@code ComparisonEngine.read(...)}. This class opens no transaction of its own and holds no
 * platform service.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Support state is read by {@link SupportStateReader} from the child nodes the platform actually
 * builds - see its javadoc for why the top-node accessor named in the 2025.2 javadoc is not used.</p>

     * predicate: {@code MdCompareUtils.isObjectAndContentInScope} tests the compared object's
     * QUALIFIED NAME against {@code handle.getScope(side)} in ONE direction only (at or UNDER an

     * {@code Catalog.Products.Form.X} the session calls the parent {@code Catalog.Products} in
     * scope while EDT excluded its own features, and it calls a non-symlink member of a genuinely
     * compared object out of scope - and nothing else readable from a node reproduces the real
     * predicate either, because the qualified name it tests comes from an
     * {@code IQualifiedNameProvider} over the compared objects and the carve-out is per feature.
     * <p>
     * So the coverage says what the run did and leaves the node's place in it to the reader. That
     * is weaker than a per-node verdict and it is the strongest thing that cannot be wrong - and

     * <h2>Walked past, not stopped at</h2>
     * The difference from {@link #flatten} is what the budget is spent ON. That one collects every
     * child of every kind, because the table it feeds renders every child. This table renders
     * sections, so a descendant that is not one costs no row and cannot raise the cap - but it is
     * still DESCENDED THROUGH, and the parameter is a {@code ComparisonNode} for exactly that
     * reason. Refusing to descend through it dropped every section beneath it out of the table
     * while the walk reported itself COMPLETE, because those sections were never visited: rows
     * vanished, and the document said the page was whole. That is a worse
     * answer than the wrong counter this walk was written to fix.
     * <p>
     * It is reachable rather than theoretical: {@code BslModuleSectionComparisonNodeImpl
     * .getChildren()} is a bridge method delegating straight into
     * {@code TopComparisonNodeImpl.getChildren()}, which answers {@code topChildren} plus
     * {@code containmentChildren} with no filtering by type. The narrow {@code EList} element type
     * on the interface is a generics declaration, and at runtime the list may carry any
     * {@code ComparisonNode}.
     *
     * <h2>The three ways it can stop short, and they say different things</h2>
     * {@link WalkBound#ROW_LIMIT} is raised only when a SECTION was actually DECLINED for want of
     * a row. Draining the row budget exactly is a complete page, and telling a caller to raise the
     * limit for a page that is already whole is a wrong number in the other direction.
     * {@link WalkBound#NODE_BUDGET} is the second: the walk stopped LOOKING, so nothing is known
     * about what lay beyond, and raising the limit would not reveal it.
     * {@link WalkBound#DEPTH_LIMIT} is the third, and it is the one that can bite while nothing at
     * all has been collected - see {@link WalkBounds}.
     *
     * <h2>The first refusal ends the walk</h2>
     * A declined row and an exhausted node budget are both GLOBAL: no later node can be collected
     * either, so everything after them is work whose only possible product is a second warning.
     * That warning was measurably wrong - a module with more direct sections than the limit
     * declined a row and then went on to spend the whole node budget, printing "the section walk
     * stopped after 10 000 nodes" beside it, which tells the caller to lower a depth that had
     * nothing to do with it. {@link WalkBounds#exhausted()} is checked on entry AND in the sibling
     * loops, so the DFS unwinds instead of running to the end of the graph.
     *
     * @param node the node to walk; collected only when it is a section
