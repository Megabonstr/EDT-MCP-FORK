/**
 * The single decision point that asks the human for consent before a destructive
 * MCP write. Every gated tool calls {@link #requireConsent(String, ConsentPreview)}
 * at its confirm-point, AFTER it has computed its preview data and BEFORE the actual
 * mutation. On {@link ConsentDecision#REJECT} the caller returns an error and mutates
 * NOTHING; on {@link ConsentDecision#ALLOW} the behaviour is byte-identical to
 * before the gate existed.
 *
 * <p><b>Decision order</b> (each step reuses an existing plugin idiom):
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>env {@code EDT_MCP_DESTRUCTIVE_CONSENT}</b> ({@code allow}/{@code ask},
 *       case-insensitive, read like {@code Toolsets.ENV_PROGRESSIVE_DISCLOSURE}) —
 *       {@code allow} WINS and returns {@link ConsentDecision#ALLOW} without any UI.
 *       This is the automated-run bypass the destructive e2e suite relies on, and the
 *       ONLY way a destructive operation proceeds with nobody watching; each such allow
 *       logs an audit line naming the tool and its preview.</li>
 *   <li><b>Headless</b>: if there is no live workbench display or no active shell
 *       (via {@link LaunchLifecycleUtils#workbenchDisplayOrNull()} /
 *       {@link LaunchLifecycleUtils#grabActiveShell()}) →
 *       {@link ConsentDecision#UNATTENDED} plus a logged info line. NEVER
 *       {@code syncExec} against a null/disposed display; NEVER block. This step
 *       REFUSES: with no human to ask, consent for an unattended run is the operator's
 *       to grant at launch (step 1), not the missing display's to grant for them.</li>
 *   <li><b>In-memory session-allow</b>: a per-tool {@link Set} populated by the
 *       dialog's "Allow for session" button. A gated tool the user allowed for the
 *       session this EDT run proceeds without a dialog.</li>
 *   <li><b>Preference level</b> via {@link ConsentSettingsService}:
 *       {@code ALLOW_ALL} → allow; {@code PER_TOOL} + the tool is in the allow-set →
 *       allow; otherwise ({@code ASK_ALWAYS}, or {@code PER_TOOL} + not allowed) →
 *       prompt.</li>
 *   <li><b>Dialog</b>: open {@link DestructiveConsentDialog}, time-bounded to
 *       {@link #CONSENT_PROMPT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS} on BOTH threading paths. Allow = OK,
 *       Reject = CANCEL, "Allow for session" adds the tool to the session set.
 *       Already on the UI thread ({@code Display.getCurrent() != null}) — the NORMAL
 *       path for the gated tools whose whole {@code execute()} is marshalled onto the
 *       UI thread before the gate is ever reached ({@code delete_metadata} /
 *       {@code modify_metadata} via {@code AbstractMetadataWriteTool}'s
 *       {@code syncExec}, {@code rename_metadata_object} via its own) — the dialog
 *       opens directly and a pre-scheduled {@link Display#timerExec} closer fires
 *       inside {@code open()}'s nested event loop to auto-close it on timeout
 *       ({@link #promptOnUiThread}). Otherwise (an MCP worker thread —
 *       {@code delete_project} / {@code delete_infobase} / {@code update_database}
 *       call the gate straight from the worker) the dialog is opened via
 *       {@code display.asyncExec} (NOT {@code syncExec}, so the UI thread is never
 *       blocked waiting on the worker) and the worker awaits a decision up to the
 *       timeout ({@link #promptWithTimeout}). Both paths race through the same
 *       decide-once {@link ConsentArbiter}: whichever side decides first wins; on a
 *       timeout win the verdict is {@link ConsentDecision#TIMEOUT} and the dialog
 *       shell is closed (best-effort) so it does not linger.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>Invariant:</b> the gate NEVER blocks indefinitely in EITHER dialog path — it
 * waits at most {@link #CONSENT_PROMPT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS} (issue #277); it NEVER blocks
 * at all in a headless / env-bypass / non-ASK (level-2/session/per-tool-allowed)
 * path; it does not deadlock when already on the UI thread; and a non-
 * {@link ConsentDecision#ALLOW} verdict ({@link ConsentDecision#REJECT},
 * {@link ConsentDecision#TIMEOUT} or {@link ConsentDecision#UNATTENDED}) mutates nothing
 * (it only returns the decision, and the caller turns it into an error via
 * {@link #consentDeniedMessage(ConsentDecision, String)}).
