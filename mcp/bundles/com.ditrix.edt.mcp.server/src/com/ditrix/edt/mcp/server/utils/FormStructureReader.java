 * Shared READER for a 1C managed form's structure: it resolves the {@code BasicForm} mdo from a form
 * FQN path and renders the editable form content model ({@code com._1c.g5.v8.dt.form.model.Form}) to a
 * full enriched Markdown document - the nested items tree (with per-element synonym/visibility/dataPath
 * and per-kind extras), an Attributes table (Name/Synonym/Type/Main/SavedData), a Commands table,
 * a Parameters table (only when the form declares parameters) and an
 * Event handlers section. The form model is read entirely through EMF reflection ({@code EObject} /
 * {@code eGet}), so this bundle needs no compile-time dependency on the form-model package (mirroring
 * {@link FormElementWriter}, the form WRITER).
 *
 * <p>This is the single home for the form-read logic that {@code get_metadata_details} (a form FQN
 * renders its structure) and {@code delete_metadata} (the form-member delete preview lists item
 * descendants) share. The supplied EObjects must still be inside their read transaction when
 * {@link #render} / {@link #getReferenceList} / {@link #nameOf} run.</p>

     * does not go through the comparison report. {@code get_metadata_details} calls the
     * three-argument {@link #render}, which passes {@link #MAX_NODES}, so a form nested that deep ran
     * the rendering thread out of stack - and a {@code StackOverflowError} is not a truncated
     * outline: it is an {@link Error}, it escapes the {@code catch (Exception)} between here and the
     * caller, and the request came back with no result at all. Widening a catch to {@code Error} is
     * not the answer; not needing one is.
     * <p>
     * <b>The ORDER and the INDENTATION are the recursion's own, and they are what the outline
     * prints.</b> An element's line comes first, then the whole subtree under each {@code items}
     * child in list order, then the subtree under each singular containment in the order
     * {@link #SINGULAR_ITEM_CONTAINMENTS} declares - plain depth-first pre-order, each child one
     * level deeper than its parent. A stack that pushed siblings forward would reverse every one of
     * those orderings, and a stack that recomputed depth from anything but its own entry would flatten
     * the outline; {@link #pushOutlineChildren} therefore pushes children in REVERSE and each entry
     * carries the depth its own line is indented to.

     * trips the cut: an element is charged when it is VISITED, and the stack visits elements in the

     * whether it is declined at the pop or left off the stack by {@link #pushOutlineChildren} -
     * see there for why those are the same elements.
     * <p>
     * <b>The budget bounds the PENDING work too, and that is the whole reason it is stated.</b> The

    /**
     * Reads a many-valued reference feature by name as a READ-ONLY VIEW of the model's own list -
     * nothing is copied and no element is touched until a caller asks for it. Returns an empty
     * list when the feature is absent or is not a many-valued reference, so callers never have to
     * null-check the list itself.
     *
     * <h2>Why a view and not the copy this used to return</h2>
     * Every caller here is capped - by a row limit, by the walk's node budget, or by nothing more
     * than {@code isEmpty()} - and the copy was taken BEFORE the cap could look at it. A form
     * whose element carries a hundred thousand handlers therefore cost a hundred thousand reads
     * and a second list of that size to answer {@code limit=1}: a cap that is paid for in full
     * bounds the OUTPUT and not the work, which is the one thing it is there for. The cost is
     * gone at the accessor rather than at one call site, because all of them have that shape.
     * <p>
     * What makes the view exact rather than hopeful is that neither list this reader is ever handed
     * has to be materialised to answer {@code size()} or {@code get(i)}, and the two are different
     * classes - which is why the property is stated and not the hierarchy. A form object in EDT is
     * a {@code BmObject}, and its many-valued features answer with {@code BmBasicEStoreEList}
     * (EMF's {@code EStoreEObjectImpl.BasicEStoreEList}), which delegates both the size and each
     * index straight to the BM store - so the copy was N store reads to answer a question about
     * one. The dynamic EMF objects the unit tests build answer with {@code BasicEList}, which is
     * array-backed. A RESOLVING list, either way, resolves the elements that are read and no
     * others, which the copy denied it.
     *
     * <h2>What the elements are, measured against the platform</h2>
     * The gate is {@link EReference} rather than "is many", and that is what makes the elements
     * {@link EObject}s without a filter. A stored reference list refuses both a wrong type and a
     * null as they go IN, in both of the families above - read out of the 2026.1 bytecode rather
     * than assumed:
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@code EcoreEList.validate} throws {@code ArrayStoreException} for an element outside
     * the reference's instance class, and {@code EObjectEList.canContainNull()} answers
     * {@code false}, which makes {@code AbstractEList.validate} refuse a null with "The 'no null'
     * constraint is violated";</li>
     * <li>{@code DelegatingEcoreEList.validate} throws the same {@code ArrayStoreException}, and
     * its {@code canContainNull()} answers {@code false} for every feature whose type is an
     * EClass - which a reference's always is.</li>
     * </ul>
     * So on the features this class reads, all of them stored containments, the filter the copy
     * performed could never drop anything, and dropping the filter drops no behaviour.
     * <p>
     * The guards at the call sites are for the case that reasoning does not reach: a DERIVED or
     * volatile feature answering with a list built by neither path -
     * {@code EcoreEList.UnmodifiableEList} wraps a raw {@code Object[]} and validates nothing, and
     * EMF's own {@code addUnique} bypasses {@code validate} - and this reader is reflective, so it
     * is handed whatever the feature answers. On such a list the guards keep a null out of the
     * accessors that would dereference it, and that is ALL they restore: its place is still
     * counted by {@code size()}, so a cap or a budget can be spent on it and a truncation reported
     * for a member that was never a child, and an element of the wrong type would surface as a
     * {@code ClassCastException} instead of being skipped. Both are strictly beyond what any
     * feature here can produce, and buying the guarantee back would mean walking every list on
     * every read - the cost this method exists to remove. A many-valued EAttribute (a feature map
     * included) answers empty, which is what the filter did for it.
     *
     * <h2>It is LIVE, and it is read-only</h2>
     * The list is the model's, so it must be read inside the same transaction as the object it
     * came from - the class's own rule already - and it must not be retained past it. Writing
     * through it would be writing to the model behind {@link FormElementWriter}'s back, so the

     *
     * <h2>The descent uses an explicit stack, and that is not a matter of taste</h2>
     * This walk used to re-enter itself once per element, and {@code budget} does not bound the
     * DEPTH it can reach - it bounds the number of elements VISITED. A form whose elements are
     * nested deeply enough therefore ran the walking thread out of stack before the budget could
     * decline anything, and a {@code StackOverflowError} is not a truncated table: it is an
     * {@code Error}, {@code GetComparisonNodeTool} catches {@code RuntimeException}, and the MCP
     * request ended with no result at all. Widening that catch is not the answer either - an
     * {@code Error} leaves the JVM in a state this bundle cannot reason about, and the comparison
     * feature deliberately rethrows one rather than turning it into a JSON error. Heap is a bound
     * the workbench can be given more of; the walking thread's stack is not. This is the same
     * conversion, for the same reason, as {@code CompareConfigurationsTool.collectTopNodes}.
     * <p>
     * <b>The ORDER is the recursion's own, and it is what the rendered table prints.</b> An
     * element's own handler rows come first, then the whole subtree under each {@code items} child
     * in list order, then the subtree under each singular containment in the order
     * {@link #SINGULAR_ITEM_CONTAINMENTS} declares - plain depth-first pre-order.
     * {@link #pushHandlerChildren} reproduces it by pushing children in REVERSE, so the first child
     * is the next one popped.
     * <p>
     * <b>{@code budget} and {@code cutShort} keep their exact meaning</b>, including WHICH element
     * trips the cut: an element is charged when it is VISITED, and the stack visits elements in the
     * very order the recursion did. An element the budget cannot reach raises {@code cutShort}
     * whether it is declined at the pop or left off the stack by {@link #pushHandlerChildren} -
     * see {@link #makeRoomForReachableChildren} for why those are the same elements.
     * <p>
     * <b>The budget bounds the PENDING work too.</b> The first de-recursion pushed every child
     * before the outer loop could look at the budget again, so one element with far more children
     * than {@link #MAX_NODES} allocated a {@link PendingElement} for each of them - the recursion
     * had returned at the budget instead, so the conversion traded stack depth for heap. The stack
     * now holds at most {@code budget} entries (or the single root entry when the budget is already
     * gone), which is the bound the guard advertises.
     *
     * <p>
     * <b>And the ROWS are bounded too, by {@link HandlerRows} rather than by this budget.</b> The
     * budget counts elements; the rows are what the elements carry, and one element carries a row
     * per bound event, so neither number bounds the other. The walk keeps going after the rows are
     * full - it has to, because whether the ELEMENT budget ran out is a different statement from
     * "there were more rows than shown", and only a walk that reaches the end of the budget can
     * make the first one honestly.
