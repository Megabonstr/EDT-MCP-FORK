 * Pins the rendered three-way report over a stubbed node set.
 *
 * <p>Three of these tests exist to fail on one specific mutation each, because a suite that only
 * checked "some text came out" would stay green on either side of the defect:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #testRequestedScopeIsNeverTheEngineExtendedScope()} fails if {@code getInputScope}
 * is swapped for {@code getScope} in the renderer - the two differ only once the engine has
 * extended the scope, which is exactly the case built here;</li>
 * <li>{@link #testAnUnfinishedNodeIsNeverRenderedAsAnAbsenceOfDifferences()} fails if an
 * unfinished node is decoded as identical or filtered away, which is how a lazily-compared
 * subtree turns into a false "nothing changed";</li>
 * <li>{@link #testAnEmptyTreeIsNeverReportedAsAnAbsenceOfDifferences()} fails if the empty-page
 * branch asks only whether something is still unfinished: with no node seen at all both
 * counters are zero, so that question turns an absence of data into a claim of equality.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The Cyrillic object name is written as escapes on purpose: one row exists to show that a
 * name is carried through the report VERBATIM, and a literal would make that assertion depend
 * on the file's encoding surviving the build (CLAUDE.md don't #7).</p>
