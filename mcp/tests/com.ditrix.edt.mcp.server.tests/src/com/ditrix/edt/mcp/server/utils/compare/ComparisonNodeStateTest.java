/**
 * Tests for the ONE decoding of a comparison node's three-sided state, and for the agreement it
 * exists to guarantee.
 *
 * <h2>What went wrong, and what these tests pin</h2>
 * A caller reads the {@code compare_configurations} report, sees a row, and expands that row with
 * {@code get_comparison_node}. Both documents describe the SAME node, and each used to decode its
 * state itself. The node view decided from MAIN-vs-OTHER alone, so an object both sides had edited
 * the SAME way away from the common ancestor - {@code hasChangedMainOther()} false, both
 * ancestor-relative flags set - fell through to "No differences", while the report the caller had
 * just read called it "changed on both sides". The expanded node contradicted the document it was
 * reached from, about a node that differs from the ancestor on both sides.
 * <p>
 * So the tests come in three kinds:
 * <ol>
 * <li>the decoder's own answers, {@link #testBothSidesChangedTheSameWayIsNotAnAbsenceOfDifference}
 * first among them;</li>
 * <li>PARITY: the two documents are rendered over the same node object and their two cells are
 * READ BACK OUT of the Markdown and compared to each other. Nothing in those assertions names an
 * expected wording, so they pin agreement rather than a string;</li>
 * <li>a ratchet: the platform accessors a verdict is decoded from appear in exactly one production
 * file. Parity between two views is restored by deleting one of two decisions; the ratchet is what
 * stops a third from being written.</li>
 * </ol>
