/**
 * Ratchet: this bundle COMPARES configurations and never merges them, and that has to be a fact
 * about the tree rather than a promise in a review.
 *
 * <h2>Three independent layers, and this test guards all three</h2>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>OSGi cannot load the merging classes.</b> {@code META-INF/MANIFEST.MF} does not import
 *       {@link #FORBIDDEN_IMPORTS}, so they are unreachable even reflectively. This is the layer
 *       that holds when somebody edits the Java.</li>
 *   <li><b>Nothing outside the facade can hold the objects a merge would be started on.</b>
 *       {@code IComparisonManager} may be named by {@link #MANAGER_HOLDERS} and
 *       {@code IComparisonSession} by {@link #SESSION_HOLDERS} - nowhere else. This is the
 *       structural half: with no manager and no session in a file, no call in that file can be a
 *       platform merge or a platform write, whatever it happens to be named. And within the two
 *       files that DO hold a session, {@link #RULE_SETTERS} must not appear either: this half reads
 *       a comparison and records nothing onto it, so the allow-list is EMPTY.</li>
 *   <li><b>The starters are not written down at all.</b> {@link #MERGE_STARTERS} must not appear
 *       ANYWHERE under the bundle source root, with an EMPTY allow-list - a mention inside a
 *       comment is a failure too. That is deliberate: the value of the rule is that grepping the
 *       tree for those names returns nothing, and a commented-out call is one keystroke from a real
 *       one. Write "the merge starters" instead.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Why a source scan and not a byte-code scan</h2>
 * The cheap check - scan the compiled classes of the registered tools - is not enough, and this
 * repository already knows why: {@code ProjectContextAdoptionRatchetTest} documents its own evasion
 * hole (an anonymous inner class is a separate class file), and a helper parked in {@code utils/}
 * is not a tool at all and would never be scanned. The dangerous call does not have to live in a
 * tool, so this walks the whole bundle source root.
 *
 * <h2>What is deliberately NOT policed by name</h2>
 * Two families of name look dangerous and are not:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code getPotentialMergeProblems*} - the engine's own account of what a merge WOULD run
 *       into. This feature reads and reports it as a POSSIBILITY; that is half the value of a
 *       three-way comparison. A substring search would ban it along with the real starters, so
 *       every name here is matched with identifier boundaries and
 *       {@link #theBoundaryDoesNotCatchTheProblemReadingCalls} pins it.</li>
 *   <li>{@code setMergeRule} on one of OUR OWN types - the rules document has a method by that
 *       name, because that is what it does: it records a decision into an XML document. It is not
 *       the platform call, and cannot be: layer 2 above proves no session exists in that file. So
 *       {@link #RULE_SETTERS} are policed only WITHIN the files allowed to hold a session, where
 *       the name can only mean the platform's. Banning the spelling everywhere would be a false
 *       positive on correct code, and this repository has measured what that costs: a gate that
 *       reddens on correct code is the gate somebody switches off.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Where each rule's non-vacuity comes from</h2>
 * A ban is worth its green only when the detector behind it can still go red. Two of the rules here
 * cannot borrow that proof from production code, because the count production code is required to
 * have is ZERO - {@link #MERGE_STARTERS} anywhere, {@link #RULE_SETTERS} inside a session holder.
 * Anchoring their non-vacuity on a production occurrence would make the ratchet demand that the very
 * thing it bans keeps existing, and would redden the build on the day that code is correctly
 * deleted. Both are proved on PLANTED sources instead - {@link #theDetectorSeesAPlantedOccurrence},
 * {@link #theDetectorSeesAnOccurrenceInAComment} and
 * {@link #theRuleSetterDetectorSeesPlantedOccurrences}. The type-confinement rules keep their
 * production anchor, because those types ARE required to be present somewhere.
