/**
 * Ratchet for the two attributes of the groups navigator content extension that decide WHERE the
 * virtual group nodes appear, and whether claiming that place is safe (issue #521).
 *
 * <p>Neither is reachable from a mock: the placement is produced by the platform sorting the tree,
 * and what the platform sorts by is declared in {@code plugin.xml}. {@code CommonViewerSorter} asks
 * {@code category(element)} for each element, which returns the SEQUENCE NUMBER of the descriptor
 * that contributed it, seeded from that descriptor's declared {@code priority}; a lower number
 * sorts first. So the priority in the manifest IS the placement, and the existing
 * {@link NavigatorEnhancementManagerTest} - which verifies that the right CNF services are called -
 * cannot see it. Group nodes silently sank to the bottom of every collection when the priority was
 * lowered, and no test failed.
 *
 * <p>The assertions live in one file on purpose: the priority and the claim are one contract. The
 * priority is the floor CNF offers, so it ties with any peer extension that also asks for it, and
 * CNF orders such a tie by extension-id hash. What bounds that is not disjointness - a peer
 * claiming {@code IWorkbenchAdapter} as a possible child DOES match a group node, since
 * {@code GroupNavigatorAdapter} extends {@code WorkbenchAdapter} - but direction and semantics:
 * {@code getParent} returns the FIRST NON-NULL answer among the matching extensions, our own
 * provider answers {@code null} for anything that is not a group node, and a peer that outranks us
 * would be asked first every time rather than half the time. Keeping the claim narrow is what
 * stops us from contesting THEIR nodes, which is the asymmetry that settled #476.
