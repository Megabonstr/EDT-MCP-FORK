/**
 * Tests for the post-write disk-export barrier in {@link AbstractMetadataWriteTool} (issues #406 and
 * #408).
 * <p>
 * The behaviour under test is the DECISION: a metadata write whose {@code .mdo} export has not
 * reached disk must not answer "done", because the two files a top-object change touches are
 * exported as independent tasks, so the working tree passes through a state where the configuration
 * references an object whose file is already gone.
 * <p>
 * Since #408 the barrier no longer re-derives WHERE the write went from the response; the call
 * states it through a {@link WriteScope} while it runs. These tests therefore drive
 * {@link AbstractMetadataWriteTool#awaitDiskExport} with an explicit scope - {@code execute} would
 * marshal onto the SWT UI thread, which no headless test has. The export environment is stubbed
 * through the package-visible seam, which is also what lets the false-refusal cases be asserted at
 * all: "the wait could not observe anything" has to be distinguishable from "the wait observed a
 * pending export".
