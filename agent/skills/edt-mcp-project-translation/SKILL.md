# EDT-MCP translation workflow

## Purpose and trigger

Use this skill to inspect configured translation resources, generate strings,
run translation, and verify localized metadata for an exact project.

## Operating rule

Read and apply [the common operating rules](../COMMON.md) before this workflow.

## Task boundary

Keep the exact project, declared language codes, existing storage/provider
topology, and localized human-facing fields in scope. Never translate
programmatic metadata names, FQNs, BSL identifiers, query fields, or 1C tokens.

## Primary workflow

1. Resolve project identity/kind with `list_projects`, declared languages with
   `get_configuration_properties`, and configured translation routes with
   `get_translation_project_info`.
2. Confirm the intended languages, project support, storage/provider scope, and
   write or external-service authority using current help.
3. Call `generate_translation_strings` or `translate_configuration` only for
   the confirmed route and requested operation. Before readback or validation,
   wait under current help and a bounded caller-approved deadline until
   `list_projects` reports the exact project as ready; on expiry stop and report
   the operation as unsettled rather than treating its success status as model
   readiness.
4. Re-read representative localized metadata with `get_metadata_details`,
   inspect the repository diff when applicable, and run targeted validation.
5. Report only identities, counts, status, and affected samples that current
   tool output actually confirms; successful execution is not proof of
   translation quality or complete coverage.

## Authority rule

Storage/dictionary writes, overwrite, external provider transmission, and any
route affecting multiple storages or projects require authority for that exact
scope.

## Stop rule

Stop on unsupported project kind, undeclared language, ambiguous or incomplete
storage topology, unreviewed overwrite/transmission, or a need to change
programmatic identifiers.

## Completion signal

Return the exact project/languages/route, confirmed operation result, verified
localized samples and diff/validation evidence, and explicit quality or
completeness gaps.
