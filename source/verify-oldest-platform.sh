# Compiles the bundle against the OLDEST supported EDT, to prove one artifact still loads there.
#
# Why this exists: the build compiles against the newest EDT target platform, while the bundle
# ships Bundle-RequiredExecutionEnvironment JavaSE-17 and lower-bound package imports that a newer
# EDT satisfies just as well as an older one. Those declarations cannot express "no method that
# only the newer EDT has": the compiler will happily bind a signature added in the newer release,
# and the older EDT then resolves the bundle and fails at the call with NoSuchMethodError. The one
# check that settles it is to compile the same sources against the older platform - which is what
# this script does, using a local EDT installation as the target platform.
#
# It is a LOCAL gate, not a CI job: 1C publishes only the current service release of each EDT
# major under https://edt.1c.ru/downloads/releases/ruby/<major>/, so an older platform is
# reproducible from an installation on disk, not from a URL.
#
# Usage:
#   bash source/verify-oldest-platform.sh /path/to/1c-edt-<oldest>-x86_64 [--java-home DIR] [--maven-home DIR]
#
# The working tree is restored on every exit path; the script fails loudly if it cannot restore.
